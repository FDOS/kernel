    * from Christian Masloch, display error on unsupported CPU
    * improve memdisk CONFIG.SYS processing support
    * ensure top of RAM correctly adjusted after moving EBDA
    * fix reading from NULL
    * merge creation date & time from old dev branch

    * Fix an error at opening a character device prefixed with invalid 
      drive letter (e.g. "@:NUL")

2011 Jun 21 - Build 2040
-------- Jeremy Davis, Bart Oldeman

+ Changes Jeremy
	* r1635 from Christian Masloch, correction for memdisk check
	* r1634 optional CONFIG.SYS options via memdisk
	* r1633 force DPT to 512 byte sectors
	* r1501 sys/sys.c: correct return value from NULL to FALSE -
	  fix compile with OW1.9
	* r1500 docs/sys.txt, sys/sys.c:
	  handle case when source not specified but filename for boot
	  sector is given (sys X: bootfile.bin)

+ Changes Bart
	* r1632 make free cluster search circular
	* r1631 do not use FSINFO if not valid
	* r1609 truncating 0 byte file should not fail
	* r1591 fix SF bug 3090610 - 386 register save/restore
	* r1569 kernel/{config.c,kernel.asm,init-mod.h,globals.h}:
	  Allocate bigger chunk of memory for INSTALL for __WATCOMC__
	  because the memory layout is different from other compilers.
	  Fixes issues mentioned by Bret Johnson and Christian Masloch
	  in freedos-user/freedos-kernel.
	* r1568 kernel/asmsupt.asm, mkfiles/owlinux.mak: Make sure the
	  DOS native and Linux cross-builds produce identical binaries.
	* r1567	drivers/rdpcclk.asm,kernel/{asmsupt,entry,irqstack,kernel,
	  nls_hc}.asm, kernel/makefile:
	  Remove useless END from nls_hc.asm, add explicit byte
          overrides for older versions of NASM for more compact code,
          and adjust silent relocation segments.
	* r1565 sys/sys.c: Change // to /* comments for Turbo C compatibility.
	* r1564 kernel/dosfns.c: If handle valid, close file in PSP
	  table before the low-level close + (perhaps) critical error.
	  Avoids closing the file twice (and hitting the critical
	  error twice) on abort/program termination.
	  Also, close can only return error 6 (DE_INVLDHNDL), not 5
	  (DE_ACCESS), see RBIL.
	* r1563 kernel/task.c: From Christian Masloch:
	  set flags to 0x200 (IF set) when transferring to int22
	  termination address.
	* r1562 kernel/fatfs.c: Check errors for callers of dir_write
	  and shrink_file. Fixes: Bug: File creation does not check
	  whether buffers are written correctly
	  (http://www.bttr-software.de/forum/forum_entry.php?id=9783)
	* r1561 kernel/blockio.c, kernel/fatdir.c:
	  No longer force flush1() and dir_write_update() to return
	  TRUE if there were disk write errors. Part 1 for fixing
	  http://www.bttr-software.de/forum/forum_entry.php?id=9783
	  Bug: File creation does not check whether buffers are
	  written correctly
	* r1560 kernel/kernel.asm:
	  Enlarge clock and block driver stacks. Thanks to Damien Guibouret
	  <damien.guibouret@partition-saving.com>.
	* r1559 kernel/fatfs.c: Fix value that is used before being initialised.
	  This lead to a drive to not be considered as FAT32 despite it is
	  (or vice-versa).
	  Thanks to Damien Guibouret <damien.guibouret@partition-saving.com>.
	* r1499 kernel/makefile:
	  With the stack changes the DOS segment has moved to 0x79.
	* r1498 kernel/irqstack.asm:
	  New irqstack.asm: irq 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 now
	  use the IBM interrupt sharing protocol for STACKS. Affect
	  int 2 too, but not IRQ 7 (INT 0fh) and IRQ 9 (INT 71h)

2009 Aug 04 - Build 2039
-------- Jeremy Davis, Bart Oldeman

+ Changes Jeremy
	* r1494, 1483 docs/sys.txt, sys/sys.c: update documentation to
	  include new options; add option to sys to force LBA or CHS
	  usage, allow using BIOS specified boot drive # on floppy,
	  add verbose output (debug prints), and reorder some steps in
	  copy() to avoid some unnecessary disk swaps on single drive systems
	* r1493 boot/boot.asm: add comment about location that may be
	  modified by sys (and some whitespace changes due to editor)
	* r1492 boot/makefile: create list file when assembling boot sectors
	* r1489 kernel/main.c: update copyright year, add some comments
	* r1488 kernel/kernel.asm: mark unused space in kernel for unused win
	  compatibility structs
	* r1487 hdr/lol.h, hdr/win.h: comment/structure info update
	* r1486 hdr/process.h: comments added
	* r1485 hdr/device.h: comments added
	* r1484 hdr/cds.h: update comments
	* r1483 docs/sys.txt: update sys usage documentation
	* r1482 boot/boot.asm, boot/makefile, boot/oemboot.asm,
	  build.bat, default.bat, hdr/debug.h, kernel/{dosfns.c,init-mod.h,
	  initdisk.c,inthndlr.c,prf.c,proto.h},sys/{fdkrncfg.c,makefile,sys.c}:
	  update sys to current version, adjust printf to support
	  percent modifier, consistent prototype, and handle text not in
	  current segment (FAR *) better, merge part of simplified debug (via
	  prints) support
	* r1467 kernel/makefile, mkfiles/generic.mak: update build process to
	  include country.sys
	* r1466 kernel/country.asm: sync country source with latest from
	  eduardocasino.es site
	* r1465 kernel/country.asm: add source for country.sys from dev
	  branch
	* r1456 hdr/version.h, kernel/globals.h: simplify how version
	  specified, enable SVN builds with revision#
	* r1455 build.bat: add convenience options to build.bat for setting
	  various defines
	* r1454 default.bat: clear some additional env variables
	* r1431 kernel/makefile, utils/exeflat.c: More verbose output of UPX
	  method (sys or exe) used and fix case without UPX so kernel boots.
	* r1385 docs/fdkernel.lsm, hdr/version.h: update version # in
	  preparation for next release and to avoid confusion between svn and
	  release kernels

+ Changes Bart
	* r1491 hdr/debug.h, kernel/{init-mod.h,kernel/int2f.asm,nls.c,prf.c, 
	  proto.h}, sys/{fdkrncfg.c,sys.c}: Use near pointers for printf()s
	  where possible. Problematic is only the case where SS!=DS (which 
	  happens sometimes in resident code), in which case va_list/va_arg
	  need to use FAR pointers. DS!=DGROUP never works, so I corrected 
	  that for NLS_DEBUG, by setting DS in int2f.asm.
	* r1490 kernel/fatfs.c: Check the BPB instead of the DPB for FAT32
	  after a BUILDBPB device call, as the DPB may still be uninitialized
	  at this point. Fixes FAT32 drives in USBDRIVE (http://bretjohnson.us)
	* r1480 utils/exeflat.c: Corrected a bug in exeflat: it was writing
	  32 bytes too many from possibly unexisting buffers after compressing
	  exe files.
	* r1479 kernel/{initdisk.c,newstuff.c}: Corrected DEBUG #if to
	  #ifdef for Turbo C and corrected debug printfs in truename().
	* r1478 kernel/newstuff.c: Simplified truename(): eliminated the
	  addSep state by adding a backslash in every new segment, including a
	  trailing backslash. Simplified . and .. logic. Converted switch to if
	  because there were few cases left.
	* r1477 kernel/dosfns.c: DosChangeDir can only return DE_PATHNOTFND
	  in case of error, so force that error code.
	* r1476 kernel/dosfns.c: Remove the wildcard check for DosChangeDir()
	  because truename() already does that.
	* r1475 kernel/newstuff.c: Use simpler code for copying the current
	  directory constructing the "truename": instead of fmemcpy followed by
	  strcpy, just use strcpy. Also use the near TempCDS more.
	* r1474 kernel/newstuff.c: Unify parse_name_ext for name and
	  extension and inline this function into truename(). This is an
	  optimization (200 bytes).
	* r1473 kernel{fatdir.c,fatfs.c,newstuff.c}: If the current directory
	  is no longer valid, call dos_cd() for the root to update the CDS
	  cluster. Call media_check explicitly in truename() as a central 
	  first and only place in directory-using DOS calls (except
	  DosFindNext) to call it.
	* r1472 kernel/{dosfns.c,newstuff.c}: The original DosGetCuDir
	  is now inlined in truename(). DosGetCuDir now does truename("D:",
	  CDS_MODE_SKIP_PHYSICAL), and this mode was changed to no longer call
	  QRemote_Fn (int2f/ax=1123).
	* r1471 kernel/newstuff.c: Fix truename("C:") where the current
	  directory is different from the root: then it should not append a
	  backslash.
	* r1470 kernel/{inthndlr.c,makefile}: Turbo C 2.01 and Linux
	  cross-compilation compatibility fixes.
	* r1469 kernel/{inthndlr.c,task.c}: For self-owning PSPs do
	  everything that a normal exit does except for closing files and
	  releasing memory (see RBIL). Thanks to Christian Masloch.
	* r1468 kernel/fatdir.c: Fix problem with cd\ reported by
	  ibid_ag@lavabit.com on the mailing list.
	* r1458 kernel/{blockio.c, fatfs.c, proto.h}: In case of
	  "not sure" if the removable media has changed, the IBM PCDOS
	  technical reference says to call BLDBPB if there are no used buffers,
	  so we only do it then, instead of flushing the buffers.
	* r1457 hdr/{xstructs.h, inthndlr.c}: Merged int21/ax=7304,
	  subfunctions 3 and 4, which work very similarly.
	* r1453 kernel/fatfs.c: Set the clean bit also on created/replaced
	  files, not just opened files, so the directory entry is only updated
	  after they are written too. Fixes SF bug #2380531.
	* r1452 kernel/initdisk.c: Use a better formula for calculating FAT12
	  clusters, by multiplying nominator and denominator by 3.
	* r1451 kernel/{fatfs.c, initdisk.c}: initdisk: further	optimizations
	  in CalculateFATData(): merging the FAT16 & FAT32 loops. 
	  fatfs: #if DEBUG fix.
	* r1450 kernel/initdisk.c: Optimized initdisk.c by using constants
	  instead of variables where possible.
	* r1449 kernel/config.c, kernel/config.h: Removed unused config
	  variables and don't detect 'y' and 'n' if we're using toupper anyway.
	* r1448 hdr/{fat.h, fatfs.c}: Cluster optimizations, mainly for FAT32
	  eliminated checkdstart, replaced (cl == FREE || cl == 1) by (cl <= 1),
	  UWORD cluster cast for FAT12/16, and merge if branches for link_fat().
	* r1447 kernel/fatfs.c: Merged if status==S_OPENED logic in dos_open,
	  cache dir_attrib, and remove unnecessary init to 0.
	* r1446 kernel/config.c: Make the built-in COUNTRY table more compact
	  and allow to merge duplicate strings for error message.
	* r1445 kernel/fatfs.c: Optimization: changed find_fname() to call
	  split_path() because find_fname was always preceeded by split_path().
	  The return code is now an error code, DE_FILENOTFND, DE_PATHNOTFND,
	  or SUCCESS, depending on the failure.
	* r1444 kernel/{fatdir.c, fatfs.c, proto.h}: Added a
	  split boolean argument to dir_open so the trick with setting the
	  dir/filename separator to 0 can be avoided, and we don't need to
	  calculate its location in split_path(). Without the trick many more
	  char * path arguments in the kernel can become "const char *".
	* r1443 utils/exeflat.c: Use tmp.exe instead of tmp$$$$$.exe -- the
	  Linux cross compilation really has trouble without quotes because $$
	  can be expanded as a shell variable when passed to system().
	* r1442 kernel/{dosnames.c, fatfs.c, makefile, proto.h}:
	  Remove dosnames.c and inline ParseDosName, because there is only one
	  user left (split_path()) which only uses it to find out if the path 
	  ends in a backslash and the length of the directory part.
	* r1441 kernel/{dosnames.c, fatdir.c, fatfs.c, proto.h}:
	  dos_findfirst() now uses split_path(). The only thing
	  that needed to be added was the need to check for "d:\" paths which
	  return DE_NFILES. Also, findfirst("d:\nonexist\*.*",D_VOLID) should
	  fail even if it actually searches in d:\.
	* r1440 kernel/{dosnames.c, newstuff.c}: The invalid pathname
	  character detection is moved from ParseDosName (dosnames.c) to
	  truename (newstuff.c), because TRUENAME should check these characters
	  before passing paths on to fatfs.c & fatdir.c.
	* r1439 kernel/fatdir.c: Corrected the if-statement && logic for
	  attributes in the findnext loop.
	* r1438 kernel/{dosfns.c, fatdir.c}: Make findfirst/findnext
	  more MSDOS compatible:
	  * ignore 0x40 (D_DEVICE) in search attribute.
	  * if you specify D_VOLID + one or more of D_HIDDEN, D_SYSTEM, and
	    D_DIR you will get files *and* volume labels in the specified
	    directory, not forced to the root directory.
	  * VOLID searches must look at the search pattern name too,
	    or do not match.
	* r1437 kernel/{dosfns.c, fatfs.c}: For read/write don't update
	  sft_posit in dosfns.c anymore so fatfs.c takes care of it.
	* r1436 kernel/{fatdir.c, fatfs.c}: Remove usage of the fnode
	  f_flags field where it is not relevant anymore. Because of the
	  explicit dir_write() calls we only need them in situations where SFTs
	  where used, that is for open files but not for directories.
	* r1435 kernel/{fatdir.c, fatfs.c}: Eliminate fcbname[] on the
	  stack: we can use dm_name_pat in the dirmatch structures instead.
	* r1434 kernel/asmsupt.asm: %if 0 unused asm functions and fix a
	  stack return problem with fstrcmp.
	* r1433 kernel/{dosnames.c, fatdir.c, fatfs.c, proto.h}:
	  Split 8.3 FCB-style filename extraction from ParseDosName
	  into a new ConvertNameSZToName83 function, also used by dir_open().
	* r1432 hdr/fnode.h, kernel/{fatdir.c, fatfs.c, globals.h, init-mod.h,
	  kernel.asm}:
	  Move the fnode fields f_diroff and f_dirstart into a referenced 
	  directory match structure with fields dm_entry and dm_dircluster.
	* r1430 hdr/nls.h, kernel/{config.c, init-mod.h, inthndlr.c, intr.asm,
	  kernel/nls.c, kernel/nls_hc.asm, kernel/proto.h}: 
	  Ported COUNTRY.SYS support from the unstable branch.
	  Simple country support is kept: COUNTRY=31 will look for country.sys
	  but if it does not exist, not complain and load the built-in info.
	* r1429 hdr/sft.h, kernel/{dosfns.c, inthndlr.c, proto.h}: Seek changes:
	  * merge unstable kernel optimizations
	  * enable seek for int2f/AX=1228
	  * -1 is a valid offset, so we need to process the return code
	    seperately
	* r1428 kernel/dosfns.c: Merge pop_dmp optimization from the unstable
	  kernel.
	* r1427 kernel/ioctl.c: This change was missed, as the changelog
	  mentioned it was in 2035a already: r_si/r_di contents added as
	  documented in PC-DOS Technical Update. I also moved the CharReqHdr
	  filling in to just before execrh, and made the command table a static
	  const so it is outside the SDA (OW places it in CONST2).
	* r1426 kernel/ioctl.c: Optimization: move the attribute checks down
	  and localize some variables.
	* r1425 kernel/ioctl.c: Streamline ioctl.c code so OW saves 2 more
	  words of stack.
	* r1424 kernel/ioctl.c: r1115 set the dpb_subunit but that was wrong
	  for get_cds() called from AX=4409. Use a local variable unit to avoid
	  that, and simplify the AX=4409 logic like in the unstable kernel.
	* r1423 kernel/ioctl.c: Inline ioctl helper routine back again. Save
	  stack by using the dev variable that points to the device smartly.
	* r1422 kernel/ioctl.c: Split DosDevIoctl into two calls so execrh
	  can be called with minimal stack usage. Always return DE_ACCESS when
	  the device fails instead of DE_DEVICE, as DE_DEVICE is only used for
	  renames between devices that are not the same.
	* r1421 kernel/fatfs.c: Introduce clear_dir() to clear a directory,
	  this was code shared between dos_mkdir() and extend_dir(). Now
	  dos_mkdir() calls this function to clear the new directory, and then
	  creates the . and .. entries using higher level functions instead of
	  dealing with the blocks directly.
	* r1420 hdr/{fnode.h, sft.h}, kernel/{fatdir.c, fatfs.c}: Make
	  the fnode f_flags completely equal to the SFT sft_flags. Rename
	  SFT_FDIRTY to SFT_FCLEAN to avoid confusion.
	* r1419 hdr/fnode.h, kernel/{fatdir.c, fatfs.c}: Eliminate the
	  fnode F_DDIR flag which has no SFT equivalent: f_sft_idx==0xff can do
	  the same. rwblock() is never called for directories so the checks
	  could be removed.
	* r1418 kernel/fatfs.c: Flip target and source checks to avoid
	  calling ParseDosName for in-directory renames. Do not allow to rename
	  directories between different directories.
	* r1417 kernel/fatfs.c: RENAME: if the source and target directories
	  are the same, rename the directory entry in-place instead of creating
	  a new one and deleting the old one. Fixes archived bugzilla bug:
	  http://www.freedos.org/bugzilla/cgi-bin/show_bug.cgi?id=1908
	* r1416 kernel/fatfs.c: Change dos_rmdir to only use 1 fnode. It now
	  first checks if the directory is empty and then opens the parent and
	  deletes the real directory. No longer returns DE_FILENOTFND(2), but
	  return DE_PATHNOTFND(3) instead.
	* r1415 hdr/dirmatch.h: Cleanup dirmatch.h: make attributes and size
	  unsigned, and make the unused dm_flags field reserved.
	* r1414 kernel/{dosfns.c, proto.h, task.c}: Introduce get_cds1 to merge
	  common code that checks for 0=default_drive,1=A,etc.
	  Make load_transfer() static.
	* r1413 kernel/chario.c: Inline cooked_write_char() into cooked_write().
	* r1411 kernel/fatfs.c: Fix compilation with Turbo C.
	* r1410 kernel/{fatdir.c, fatfs.c, proto.h}: Eliminate dir_close().
	  Its only purpose left was to flush buffers, which isn't necessary
	  after just open/read, so we can move that to dir_write().
	* r1409 kernel/{dosfns.c, fatfs.c}:
	  Move the open/creat access checks to more efficient places.
	* r1408 kernel/fatfs.c: Make merge_file_changes more direct dealing
	  with SFTs and merge the "close open files setfattr wants to change"
	  functionality there.
	* r1407 kernel/dosfns.c: Eliminate DosGetFile -- it is no longer
	  necessary because the filename is already copied from the fnode.
	* r1406 kernel/dosfns.c: Fix a regression with sft_flags overwriting
	  what dos_open wrote so file dates/times would always be updated, even
	  for reads!
	* r1405 kernel/{dosfns.c, fatdir.c, fatfs.c, fcbfns.c, proto.h}:
	  Eliminate dos_setfsize, dos_setftime, and dos_lseek, by just using
	  the SFT. dos_setfsize	still needed to merge changes for SHARE so the
	  call was replaced by a new dos_merge_file_changes() call.
	* r1404 hdr/fnode.h, kernel/{fatdir.c, fatfs.c}: Eliminate
	  xlt_fd(), save_far_f_node(), and the redundant fnode f_mode field.
	* r1403 kernel/{dosfns.c, fatfs.c}: Let merge_file_changes
	  operate directly on the other SFTs. dos_setfattr with SHARE now
	  closes open SFTs referring to that file in compat mode.
	* r1402 kernel/fatfs.c: Fix SFT/fnode fields so the SHARE related
	  functions is_same_file() and merge_file_changes() work.
	* r1401 hdr/fnode.h, kernel/{fatfs.c, globals.h}: Remove
	  redundant checks for fnodes==0 since the checks are done in dosfns.c.
	  Replace global f_nodes[] array by f_sft_idx fields in the fnodes.
	* r1400 hdr/sft.h, kernel/{dosfns.c, fatfs.c, fcbfns.c,	proto.h}:
	  Eliminate the sft_status field as it is now equal to the SFT index.
	* r1399 kernel/{dosfns.c, fatfs.c, proto.h, task.c}:
	  Eliminate dos_getftime, dos_getfsize, and dos_getfattr_fd, because we
	  can now get these properties directly from the SFT.
	* r1398 hdr/fnode.h, kernel/{fatdir.c, fatfs.c, proto.h}:
	  Eliminate f_count field in fnodes and some no-op functions.
	* r1397 hdr/{fnode.h, lol.h}, kernel/{config.c, dosfns.c, fatfs.c,
	  globals.h, kernel.asm, proto.h}:
	  This is the main change to eliminate far fnodes. SFT info is copied
	  from and to the two near fnodes. Some cleanups still follow.
	* r1396 hdr/sft.h:
	  Make the SFT DOS 4+ compatible and change fields to be unsigned.
	* r1395 kernel/dosfns.c:
	  Handle sft_count before calling dos_open and after calling dos_close
	  so the SFT is open for longer, during fatfs.c	operations.
	* r1394 kernel/prf.c: Fix compilation with -DDOSEMU set.
	* r1393 kernel/{dosfns.c, fatfs.c}: Handle dos_getfattr and
	  dos_setfattr directly at the directory level, instead of opening the
	  file, to avoid needing to claim SFTs in later changes. Clarify and
	  implement parts of the correct SHARE behaviour.
	* r1392 hdr/fat.h, kernel/{fatdir.c, fatfs.c, proto.h}:
	  On close or commit, only update those directory entry fields that
	  have an SFT equivalent. The rest stays unmodified on disk.
	* r1391 kernel/{fatdir.c, fatfs.c}: Use explicit dir_write()
	  instead of letting dir_close() do the writing. This is to prepare for
	  an updating version to deal with SFTs.
	* r1390 hdr/fnode.h, kernel/fatdir.c: Add f_dirsector (sector
	  containing dentry) and f_diridx (index within sector) fields to the
	  fnode, to make fnodes more compatible with SFTs. Use them to simplify
	  dir_read() and dir_write().
	* r1389 kernel/{fatdir.c, fatfs.c, globals.h, inthndlr.c, lfnapi.c, 
	  proto.h}: Force near fnode use to use either fnode[0] or fnode[1] 
	  instead of the allocation scheme. This eliminates the checks
	  done in inthndlr.c because the f_count field is no longer checked.
	* r1388 makefile, mkfiles/owlinux.mak: Change Linux makefiles to only
	  update what is necessary for subsequent makes.
	* r1387 config.m, docs/build.txt, drivers/makefile, kernel/{makefile,
	  segs.inc}, makefile, mkfiles/{generic.mak, owlinux.mak, watcom.mak}, 
	  sys/makefile, utils/{exeflat.c, makefile}:
	  Add Linux cross-compile capability, using Open Watcom:
	  * Flip \ to /	where possible.
	  * Introduce $(DIRSEP) (/ or \) for use inside commands in
	    makefiles where / won't work in DOS.
	  * Override various settings for Linux in owlinux.mak.
          * Add quotes in exeflat.c to avoid shell expansion of $$$$$.
          * Let "make all", "make clean", and "make clobber" do the job.
	* r1386 utils/echoto.bat: OW 1.8 MS2WLINK is too picky about leading
	  and trailing whitespace so echoto is changed to not generate any.

2009 May 16 - Build 2038
-------- Pat Villani, Bart Oldeman, Eric Auer

Thanks to Geraldo Netto for summarizing the 2008 SVN changelog. See also:
http://freedos.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/freedos/kernel/trunk/?view=log
Patches are mostly from Bart and Eric, some from Jeremy and Tom.

+ Changes Jeremy 2009

	* r1412 from Eric: update this history.txt (and bugs.txt, contrib.txt)
	* r1381-r1384 update bugs.txt version.h LSM, tag SVN for 2038 release
	* r1374, r1380 fcbfns FCB open old GEM compat (bigsize/recsiz/recno)
	  http://sf.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2253450&group_id=5109&atid=355109
	* r1379 dosfns.c fatfs.c proto.h from Eric: only check for SHARE on
	  open/close, avoid extra 2f.1000 calls.
	* r1378 dsk.c from Lucho: Press any key, not Press the any key  ;-) 
	* r1377 initdisk.c from RayeR: Use total cyl count, not max cylinder
	  (fixes off by one bug on non-LBA PC) & fix overflow by ULONG cast.
	  Improve DebugPrintf calls, fix format string (only in debug kernels)
	* r1376 inthndlr.c from Tom: 21.1c return AL=0xff for invalid drives
	  (fixes bug for apps which use int 21.1c to find FAT drive letters)
	* r1372, r1375 from Bart: process.h/entry.asm make CP/M call PSP[5]
	  work (1 line jbe versus ja fix and detailed comments about stack)
	  This fixes SF tracked bug 2421577.
	* r1373 kernel.asm add : after _HMATextAvailable avoid nasm warning
	* r1371 watcom.mak make sure even Windows Watcom C builds a DOS SYS
	  (would otherwise make a SYS meant for use in Windows by default)
	* r1370 default bat make compiling without UPX possible again
	* r1369 let DosGetExtFree 21.7303 accept drive with and w/o slash
	  This fixes SF tracked bug 2380828 (GetDiskFreeSpaceEx if no slash)
	* r1368 tag for ke2038test

+ Changes Bart + Eric (mostly)
	* r1367 sys.c from Bart: 32bit date/time if WATCOMC 1279+ (OW 1.8)
	* r1366 config.c, config.txt allow BUFFERSHIGH as alias to BUFFERS,
	  buffers are in UMB, we use HMA anyway. Drop unused int 16.1 call.
	* r1365 inthndlr.c allow/ignore type hints in int 21.7305 disk read
	* r1364 fdkernel.lsm and version.h updated to 2038 / Apr 2008
	  Updated this history.txt changelog to state of April 2008
	* r1363 add Geraldo (changelog) and Fritz (docs) to contrib.txt
	  New version of config.txt - verbose, readable, up to date
	* r1362 update readme.cvs - add info about SVN / subversion
	* r1361, 1355 update information about bugzilla. You can also
	  write the maintainer or mailinglist but we prefer bugzilla...
	  Add information about SourceForge feature request tracker, too
	* r1360 new Free Software Foundation (FSF) mail addr in COPYING
	* r1359 BIOS y2k bug workaround: If BIOS date 1900..1979, assume
	  date 2000..2079 (we only read CMOS date at boot) Fix bug 1748
	* r1358 more secure FAT handling to avoid crosslinks if reboot
	  with open files: Thanks to Hardi Stengelin for research help;
  	  always test link_fat result, new is_free_cluster, checks in
	  link_fat and next_cluster (bad index/value, bad chain / extend
	  -> warning). Do link_fat before setdstart. Lazy FS INFO writes
	* r1357 truename must use the current working directory of the
	  created-by-subst virtual drive when it resolves relative paths
	  even though the "real" drive/dir are returned in the end. Note
	  that "subst e: d:\" shows a warning as it tries "mkdir d:\"
	  Fixes bug 1862 "CHDIR fails on substituted drives"
	* r1356 SYS has to update the backup boot sector of FAT32, else
	  dosfsck would show a warning about a boot / backup mismatch
	* r1354 Use _dos_allocmem for OW, similar to Turbo C version
	  Split file copy into readfile and writefile, nicer source code
	  Preserve time and date of kernel.sys and command.com
	* r1353 let exeflat call UPX, simpler makefile as in unstable branch
	* r1351, 1352 exeflat reorganization, no functional changes
	* r1350 add ASM/CDECL to HaltCpuWhileIdle decl, fix Turbo C compile
	* r1349 change copy() in SYS to "read to RAM, update boot, write to
	  disk", reduces disk changes on single floppy PC, fixes bug 1840
	* r1348 treat load image size of EXE modulo 1 MB, do not abort if
	  size > 1 MB. Fixes bug 1854, Turbo C++ 3: paras=(word)(pages<<5)
	* r1346 init HaltCpuWhileIdle to 0 before installing int handlers
	* r1345 int 21.5a mktemp: only enforce root tempfile name if no dir
	  is given in template *and* DOS version is 5.xx, else no dirspec
	  Tried to make int 21.60 truename return 0 if okay, 3a00 if char
	  device and not join/net?? Set default FAT16 DOS version to 6.22
	  (was 5.0, only int 21.5a/21.60 and userland differ from 6.22)
	* r1344 clarified intfns.txt for int 21.63 (country/nlsfunc), int
	  21.71 (LFN) and int 21.5d0x (share). The latter would need both
	  kernel and SHARE extension to be supported, neither are done yet
	* r1341, 1343: fix Bochs incompatible (PostConfig crash) IRQTEXT,
	  now with corrected segment loads in irqstack.asm (segs->groups)
	  This fixes a problem introduced in SVN revision 1325/1326. We now
	  have a "fastboot" int 19 reboot hook from Japheth's JEMM JEMFBHLP
	* r1342 fix fat32readwrite prototype, reg use in detect LBA pragma


2007 Jul 21 - Build 2036 svn, in other words, 2038 pre
-------- Eric Auer (eric@coli.uni-sb.de)

Thanks to Geraldo Netto for summarizing the SVN changelog - See also:
http://freedos.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/freedos/kernel/trunk/?view=log
All main features of Tom's fork are available in kernel 2038 now.

+ Changes Bart + Eric
	* r1340 version 2038pre/2036svn (fdkernel.lsm, version.h, history)
	* r1339 new IDLEHALT=n (HLT on idle, save energy) and KEYBUF=n[,m]
          (relocate keyboard buffer, eg to 40:105-1ff) config.sys options
	* r1338 removed "Dutch plurals" ("Dutch plural's" ;-))
	* r1336-1337 disable interrupts while storing interrupt vectors,
	  fix 8086 compatibility again
	* r1335 use lastdrive Z for initial CDS, so device=f:... etc works
	* r1334 fix bug 1953: int 21.29 now returns valid only for existing
	  drives, not for all, and leave FCB empty/unset if no valid drive
	  http://sf.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2362450&group_id=5109&atid=105109
	* r1333 fix stack for UPX compression as .sys, fix size limit 65420
	* r1332 fix F5/F8 zero timeout handling in GetBiosKey
	* r1331 some config.txt / contrib.txt updates merged from UNSTABLE
	* r1330 fix Turbo C compilation: nls.* adds ASM/CDECL nlsInfoBlock
	  and makefile uses "$(COMSPEC) /c if exist" in UPX handling
	* r1329 UPX compress kernels below 64k as .sys, save 2k disk space
	* r1328 process relocations before compressing kernel, save 130 by
	* r1327 use more flexible exeflat UPX trailer from unstable branch
	* r1325-1326 new IRQTEXT segment, put pre-boot interrupt vectors
	  at 70:100 so int 19 reboot with JEMM386 "fastboot" can work
	  (see r1341, r1343: this introduced a later fixed problem...)
	* r1324 add SHARE driver/TSR for file locking to main SVN branch
	* r1323 fix bug 1956: use segment, not offset, for file handle NULL
	  check - otherwise apps which allocate their own FILES can break
	* r1322 fix problem with old game which uses findfirst attrib 77a8
	  (do not return volume label as findfirst/findnext result here)
	* r1320 add some comments about what intr() does
	* r1319 read partitioning via CHS (unless Cyl>1023 / LBA forced via
	  SYS CONFIG) for better compat with old boot managers like "PROT"
	* r1318 avoid compile time warning with OpenWatcom 1.7 in-devel
	* r1313 call_nls optimization: ID in high word of long, no pointer
	* r1312 always set lr.ES just before break, so OW can tail merge
	* r1308 avoid OW 1.6 warnings about functions redeclared as static
	* r1307 fix OW warning about comparing unsigned int to <= 0...
	* r1306 NUL device has to return 0 bytes for reads even in raw
	  mode - fixes problem with DJGPP sed (possibly also bug 1793?)

+ changes merged from Tom's extra stable fork of kernel 2035a:
	* r1321 only move EBDA if ramsize == peek(0, RAMSIZE)
	* r1317 extra free of near f_nodes to avoid INT24 problems
	* r1316 remove unused intr prototype for resident code,
	  add dir kernel.exe to build process, cosmetic p=A -> p = A
	* r1315 set OEM name in boot sector to FRDOS5.1 (5 uppercase
	  letter, 4 or 5, dot, digit: Win9x seems to like that better...
	* r1314 implement int 2f.4a00 "DJ style" floppy change call
	  (let GUIs hook "Insert disk..." dialog on single floppy systems)
	  Some forgotten bits of int2f.asm NLS related updates
	* r1311 optimized method to set extended error (smaller)
	* r1310 use a command table for IOCTL, save ca 83 bytes
	* r1309 fix typo "booot"

+ these changes are already in FreeDOS 1.0 kernel 2036cvs Aug 18 2006:
	* r1305 build system adjustments - suppress dos4g banner etc
	* r1304 fix MS QB4 (QBasic/QuickBasic) problem, allow double free
	  (freed MCBs are unlinked from the chain but not invalidated)
	* r1303 only use 28 bits of FAT32, mask out others, add logging
	* r1302 add COMn/AUX func 6 (input status), remove read wait for DSR


2006 May 20 - Build 2036 cvs and 2037 test
-------- Eric Auer (eric@coli.uni-sb.de)

WARNING: This changelog entry is a draft! The cvs log contains
  data for both HEAD and UNSTABLE branch while a cvs checkout
  seems to return only the HEAD branch. This file history.txt
  should describe "2036 cvs" HEAD and "2037 test" UNSTABLE
  separately rather than in one merged changelog item.

In addition, the "Changes Eric" items yet have to be ported to
  the UNSTABLE branch and the version.h for UNSTABLE should say
  "03 Mar 2006" "2037 test" (revision 37)...!

Most recent changes to source code (see version.h) are:
  HEAD 9 Sep 2005 (not counting the Korean stub and execrh change
    by Eric, and not counting the version number change itself)
  UNSTABLE 3 Mar 2006 (includes SYS changes, more Win3 support,
    COM port output for debug print, the SHARE tool...)
    The head to unstable diff in general is quite large. As a rule
    of thumb, use UNSTABLE if you need NLSFUNC or Win3 386 mode or if
    you need a very new kernel, and use HEAD if you need stability.

+ Changes Jeremy
	* build.bat, config.b: UPX and WIN3 build options, for BUILDALL
	* boot/oemboot.asm: set backup boot sector on FAT32, add update
	  option, fix oemboot to work with msdos 7+, in UNSTABLE branch.
	* docs/bugs.txt: update Bugzilla URL
	* docs/config.txt: document SWITCHES, based on suggestions from Eric
	* docs/contrib.txt, docs/fdkernel.lsm: new email address
	* docs/sys.htm, docs/sys.txt: see oemboot.asm
	* docs/sys.txt: better check for valid backup boot sector # and add
	  option to skip setting it
	* hdr/debug.h, kernel/prf.c: slight cleanup, send debug prints to COM
	  port, allow printf to work correctly when SS!=DS, debug changes
	* hdr/device.h: add comments about what flags mean
	* hdr/portab.h: from dev: add MK_PTR and MK_SEG_PTR macros
	  add/use halt() wrapper for issuing "hlt" asm instruction
	* hdr/version.h: update version to 2035b-cvs (= not a release yet)
	* kernel/config.c: fix read calls to detect error, from Eric / Brad
	* kernel/console.asm, newstuff.c, prf.c, task.c: compile time option
	  to send debug output to COM port ("serial debugging console")
	* kernel/dosfns.c: do not compares filenames to name field in block
	  devices, extra win3 support, misc debug output changes, IsDevice
	  should not compare filenames against block device driver headers
	* kernel/dsk.c: works towards better SS!=DS support, centralized
	  debug macros, some comments
	* kernel/entry.asm: more win3 support, debug output changes, comments
	* kernel/execrh.asm: protect 386 registers, using hdr/stacks.inc
	  macros (Watcom: FS, GS Others: high 16 bits of EAX EDX, for MSCL8
	  also ECX, for BC5 also EBX), for ALL device driver calls. Without
	  this, some versions of free-EMM386 crash 386 optimized kernels.
	  See list archives 24 Jul 2005 and later.
	* kernel/fatfs.c: don't leave fd open when failing DIR bit check
	  bug 1874 fix, do not consider setting DIR bit an error for
	  int 21/4301=set attribute, if really is a directory
	  Added some disabled debug messages, improved win3 support.
	* kernel/init-mod.h: allow printf to work correctly when SS!=DS
	* kernel/initdisk.h: insure bpb_huge is initialized (zeroed) [merge
	  from dev kernel], fake floppy ddt so hd access works correctly on
	  floppyless systems, based on suggested fix from Eric
	* kernel/int2f.asm kernel.asm main.c: initial BIOS disk int 13h wrapper,
	  only passively detects and notes floppy disk change, more win3 support
	* kernel/inthndlr.c: potential fix for spurious near fnodes!=0 msg with
	  shsufdrv and >2 near fnodes in use for bug 1879, use halt() wrapper,
	  more win3 support, some debug output changes.
	* kernel/intwrap.asm: assembly glue to wrap misc interrupts with C
	  handler, cleaner push immediate from Arkady and note big bug to be
	  fixed, later moved to UNSTABLE branch (also affects makefile)
	* kernel/proto.h: fix prototype, add FAR
	  allow printf to work correctly when SS!=DS
	* mkfiles/generic.mak: undo a local only change, build list option
	  is proper way to do this. more win3 support, upx build option.
	* mkfiles/watcom.mak: allow printf to work correctly when SS!=DS
	* share/MAKEFILE, share/share.c, share/share.hlp: FreeDOS SHARE
	  (initial revision, later moved to UNSTABLE branch)
	* sys/fdkrncfg.c: sync printf prototypes (uncorrupt executables)
	* sys/sys.c: sync printf prototypes (uncorrupt executables)
	  better check for valid backup boot sector # and add option to skip
	  setting it. set backup boot sector on FAT32, add update option,
	  fix oemboot to work with msdos 7+

+ Changes Eric
	* kernel/globals.h changed the os_release version message to be
          "build 2036 cvs [version Sep 09 2005 compiled May 20 2006]" as
	  opposed to the old
	  "version 1.1.35 (Build 2035b-cvs) [Jul 23 2005 12:34:56]"
	  -> removed the "1.1.35" and compile TIME, added SOURCE DATE
	* hdr/version.h removed some no longer used version defines
	  Changed build to "2036 cvs" (revision 36)
	  WARNING: Version should be "2037 test" (revision 37) for UNSTABLE!
        * docs/history.txt: summarized log -d '>Feb 25 2005' kernel for this
	  WARNING: some of the described changes might be available only
	  in the UNSTABLE cvs branch (like SYS OEMBOOT, Win3, COM port
	  output for debug print, the SHARE tool, ...)
	* kernel/execrh.asm: removed the "protect 386 registers" patch
	  again, a fixed version of free-EMM386 is available. This reduces
	  device driver call overhead in terms of CPU and stack usage.
	  Older EMM386 versions destroyed eax ebx ecx edi esi ebp fs gs,
	  now go_driver_entry in emm386.asm saves those registers. Only the
	  INIT was broken, but the execrh.asm patch protected ALL functions.
	* share/share.c: changes to reduce TSR memory footprint
	* kernel/inthndlr.c: added stub for function 0x6301/0x6302 Korean
	  Hangul keyboard input methods (0x63xx is DBCS support related)
	* docs/intfns.txt: updated list of supported DOS functions. When
	  DOSLFN is loaded for int 21.71, only remaining unsupported int
	  21 functions are 21.4b05 (set execution state), int 21.63xx
	  (DBCS / Korean Hangul, see above) and int 21.5d01 - 21.5d05
	  (close files by name/computer/task, list open files, commit all)
	* made linebreaks in all batch files use CR LF, as Unix line breaks
	  confuse command.com, leading to "early abort" or "endless loop"

+ Changes Lucho
	* kernel/chario.c: Fix Ctrl-Z bug and retro-optimise a bit
	* kernel/config.c, sys/sys.c: Fix BC 3.1 CONFIG.C compile and
	  SYS Abnormal Program Termination error for BC
	* sys/sys.c: fix update option (compared too many characters)

+ Changes Eduardo
	* kernel/config.c: fix Spanish (34, not duplicate of 33)
	* kernel/inthndlr.c: add int 2f subfunc 122B and 122D

+ Changes Jason
	* kernel/fatfs.c: extended DPBs and Set Extended Error function
	* kernel/inthndlr.c, kernel/proto.h: same

+ Changes Arkady
	* kernel/inthndlr.c: use direct access instead of reading from copy
	  made on stack
	* kernel/intwrap.asm, kernel/kernel.asm: cleaner push immediate from
	  Arkady and note big bug to be fixed

+ Changes Michael
	* share/share.c: bugfixes

+ Changes Japheth
	* share/share.c: HXDOS related improvements

+ Changes Bart
	* kernel/main.c: patch to make device=f:\foo.sys work. String printf
	  optimisation


2005 Feb 25 - Build 2035a
-------- Jeremy Davis (jeremyd@computer.org)
+ Changes Bart
        * int2f.asm: call_nls: DI register was not preserved (bug 1812)
+ Changes Arkady
	* floppy.asm: fix epilog for FL_SETMEDIATYPE & FL_SETDISKTYPE
	  to use 'ret' instead of 'ret 8'; improve comments
	* entry.asm: use unsigned comparision instead of signed
+ Changes Lucho
	* dsk.c: text in play_dj
	* fatfs.c:
          - zero creation/access stamp on directory entry write as MS-DOS 7.10
          - prevent removal or renaming of the current directory of that drive
	* ioctl.c:
	  - r_si/r_di contents added as documented in PC-DOS Technical Update
	* inthndlr.c
	  - fix: for INT21/5F07 and 5F08, before changing bit CDSPHYSDRV,
	    MS-DOS checks if physical device associated with drive letter. Without
	    this check MS-FORMAT under FreeDOS was destroys RAMDISK.
	  - zero serial number of Int 21h/30h (else buggy 32RTM thrashed stack) [& Bart]
	  - set AX = ES after Int 21h/4Ah (undocumented but expected by BRUN45)
	    (the last 2 changes needed to fix bugs discovered by Michael Devore)
	  - added Int 2Fh/2Fh processing to set DOS version as per MS-DOS 4.0
+ Changes Eduardo
	* inthndlr.c: added Int 2Fh/26-29h processing for NLSFUNC (with Lucho)


2004 May 30 - Build 2035
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Changes Lucho + Tom
	* config.c, fatfs.c, globals.h, init-mod.h: From Tom: must
	  set r_bpfat for C_BLDBPB, otherwise USBASPI.SYS, DI1000DD.SYS
	  won't like us. From Lucho: use DiskTransferBuffer for deblock_buf.
+ Changes Lucho
	* docs/fdkernel.lsm, stacks.inc, version.h,
	  entry.asm, inthndlr.c, io.asm, nlssupt.asm: no need to preserve
	  high part of ecx for Borland, ebx for MSVC
	* device.h, dsk.c, init-mod.h, ioctl.c:  MSC fixes and small cleanup
	* ioctl.c: Cache attr and control flow optimizations (~120 bytes)
	* device.h, dsk.c, ioctl.c: deal with the correct
	  structure for generic and query ioctls. Fixes issues with
	  3rd party device drivers (or ones that use dsk.c)
	* dosfns.c, inthndlr.c, proto.h: Merge dosmkdir and dosrmdir
	* config.c: strcasecmp and set_strategy common code optimizations.
	* main.c: Add necessary cast for BC
	* portab.h: Avoid problem with BC declaring __emit__, en/disable twice.
	* dsk.c: DJ mechanism without memcpy.
	* newstuff.c: replace loops by fmemset/fmemcpy (43 bytes)
	* dosfns.c, fatdir.c, fcbfns.c, ioctl.c: Some small cleanups.
	* config.c: GetNumArg and misc other cleanups
	* time.h, fatfs.c: converted TM_ENCODE into a function.
	* inthndlr.c, proto.h, fatfs.c: Inlined dos_setdta.
	  Various bug fixes and cleanups from Lucho and Arkady.
	* inithma.c: moved fmemcmp's into a checkHMA function.
	* inithma.c: HMAFree == 0xfff0 - bytesToAllocate
	  is valid and may happen if the buffers occupy exactly all HMA
	  space up to and including the last byte at ffff:ffff. Failing
	  caused all buffers to go low ...
	* inthndlr.c: cleanups (merge common code into long_check and
	  short_check). Made int21/3301,2e,54 consistent with MSDOS
	  behaviour.
	* globals.h, task.c, main.c: Convert setvec into a function
	  for the resident code
+ Changes Arkady
	* initdisk.c: initdisk optimizations (65 bytes) and is_suspect fix.
	* config.c, init-mod.h, intr.asm: optimized allocmem()
	* fattab.c, kernel.asm: optimizations
	* main.c: Make signon one big printf function call.
	* ioctl.c: bugfix for INT21/440b (change NetRetry if DX is _non_zero).
	* inthndlr.c: cntry == 0 doesn't make sense for Set Country
	  Information. Fix int21/5e02+
	* sys/talloc.c: Turbo C really wants unsigned __brklvl. Only shows
	  up if you enable stack checking.
+ Changes Bart
	* memmgr.c, proto.h, inthndlr.c: DosUmbLink no longer
	  tries to merge free blocks. Also cleaned up a bit.
	* inthndlr.c: Fix int21/3302 (the swap was wrong, Lucho & Bart)
	* config.c: Pointer-ise specificCountriesSupported accesses.
	* config.c: Reorganized GetBiosKey a bit -- inlining
	  GetBiosTime saves a slight amount of code, converted timeout < 0
	  to a blocking read instead of polling.
	* config.c: Use strcaseequal instead of strcasecmp since we
	  never care about order anyway.
	* chario.c: Fix problem with redirected input and
	  int21/ah=0a (debug < foo.txt) -- could get you an invalid opcode!
	* console.asm, main.c, prf.c: Use int29 for kernel console
	  output. Enables ansi escape sequences in config.sys once you load
	  nansi.sys. It also saves a couple of bytes.
	* newstuff.c, proto.h: made dosmktmp to return a long:
	  consistent with DosOpen et al and avoids the cast.
	* mkfiles/tc2.mak: Let TC2 warn for the utilities.
	* config.c: Disabled EBDA moves by default. Automatic EBDA
	  moves now happen using switches=/e:-1
	* config.c: Pointer-ize MenuStruct[MenuSelected]... (from
	  Lucho). and InstallCommands[i].  (from Bart). Some other small
	  optimizations.
	* memmgr.c: Some small optimizations (46 bytes) and dead
	  code removal from Lucho and Bart
	* init-mod.h: Need to define strchr to init_strchr otherwise
	  the wrong one may be called.
	* initdisk.c: Do a bit of printf merging.
	* filelist, drivers/makefile, init-mod.h, inthndlr.c,
	  task.c, globals.h, main.c: Convert getvec into a C function.
	* int2f.asm: Clean up int2f assembly a bit (merge some
	  common bits, clarify label names)
	* fatfs.c, fattab.c: fattab.c now remembers if the old FAT
	  entry was free or not, so the free space adjustment could be
	  moved back to fattab.c.
	* init-mod.h: Replaced setvec macro by a function.
	* entry.asm, inthndlr.c: Made int21/ah=25,35 reentrant.
	  Solves problem with Intel PRO/1000 driver.
	* portab.h, globals.h, main.c: Initialise all int
	  vectors except the ones at 70:xxxx using a table.  Convert setvec
	  into a function that disables/enables ints (init code only for
	  now, resident code will follow later); cli/sti (disable/enable)
	  are now macros (inlined).
	* fnode.h, fatdir.c, fatfs.c: dir_read() no longer updates the
	  diroff counter. This eliminates the NEW field,
	  simplifies remove_lfn_entries(), and avoids a bug if you delete
	  the first entry in the root directory on FAT32.
	* fattab.c: Stop abusing "idx". The OW optimizer likes this better,too.
	* fattab.c: Clean up FAT12 handling -- there's a portable
	  approach that's small too.
	* fattab.c: Inlined much of getFATblock() into link_fat.
	  Saves the idx reference.  The second call (for a FAT12 entry that
	  is divided in two sectors) can be much simpler, no need to
	  recalculate. Merged next_cluster and link_fat into one
	  function depending on a special Cluster2 value.
	* fattab.c: Calculate the nibble/word/dword index of the FAT
	  entry in the sector centrally in getFATblock.
	* fattab.c: "clussec" can be of CLUSTER size if we divide by
	  an adjusted "words per sector"(FAT16), or "dwords per
	  sector"(FAT32) value instead of multiplying it first. For FAT12
	  the *3/2 works out a little differently: here we first multiply
	  by 3 and then divide by the number of "nibbles per sector".
	* main.c: Config.cfgInitTail is a pointer now so sizeof
	  isn't good. Just using strcpy helps F5 and F8.
	* main.c: "copyright" is near now so we have to use %s and not %S
	* blockio.c, dosfns.c, int2f.asm, network.c, proto.h, task.c:
	  reduced the number of network redirector functions in
	  int2f.asm. The remote_ functions (with one far pointer
	  argument) are now called with the help of a
	  network_redirector() wrapper in C by one multiplex function
	  using a generic void *arg argument to pass the third
	  parameter which can be various things.
	  Split int2f.asm functions, don't let them preserve as many
	  registers, use pascal calling convention for the "open"
	  (but really: multiplex) function.
	* dsk.c: floppy determination type optimization for format --
	  based on Arkady's suggestions a long time ago.
	  + a few other small optimizations (~70 bytes total).


2004 Apr 17 - Build 2034
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
    * break.c, chario.c, inthndlr.c, proto.h: Improve ctrl-c/ctrl-break
      handling:
      - read_char_sft_dev handles ^C at a fairly high level.
      - ^C didn't work for int21/ah=3f. Corrected
      - Do_DosIdle_loop still needs to wait even if it doesn't call the
        idle int
      - ^C needs to be echoed to STDOUT for low character functions
        (ah<0xd) but to the device that is read from for handle
	functions. So we need to pass either the STDOUT sft or that
        device on to the ^C echoer which now correctly prints ^C\r\n.
      - misc cleanups in break.c.
    * main.c: Move memset up a little else it would overwrite too much.
    * build.txt, config.c, init-mod.h, initdisk.c, inithma.c, main.c: Lucho
      reported that MSC compiled kernels now work after all. Let's mark
      those nasty "BSS" variables explicitly then to try to avoid
      future problems. Also DATASTART should be FAR and not DOSFAR for MSC
    * stacks.inc, generic.mak, entry.asm, int2f.asm, kernel.asm, segs.inc:
      (suggested by Arkady): use CPU to enforce 8086 etc instructions.
    * ioctl.c: Correct int21/ax=4401: returned AL = old value, should
      set CY and DE_INVLDDATA if DH!=0 (RBIL is a little confusing here).
    * memmgr.c: Converted nxtMCBsize back to a macro. There is no need
      to use far2para; FP_SEG works fine since MCBs always have offset 0.
    * build.txt, config.c, config.h, kernel.asm, main.c, segs.inc, task.c:
      Removed obsolete BYTE cfgCSYS_fnam[NAMEMAX]; config variable. Changed
      cfgInit and cfgInitTail to pointers, adjusted some code to cooperate.
    * chario.c: The screen position (for TABs) is only for raw
      *CONOUT* devices already updated in dosfns.c
    * memmgr.c, proto.h: Make unnecessary far pointers near.
    * device.h, dsk.c, initdisk.c: Move the ddt bitfields to
      df_descflags. Let SetLogDev call GetLogdev, eliminating common code.
    * init-mod.h, mscl8.mak: Some vars need to be DOSFAR;
      init code is no longer tiny but small.
    * segs.inc, inithma.c, main.c, asmsupt.asm, execrh.asm, init-mod.h,
      kernel.asm, watcom.mak:
      Make CS the same for INIT and HMA text for Watcom. Move HMA text
      up in kernel.asm. Use std for the memory move: helps if there's
      overlap (PCs with a very low amount of RAM).
      No longer include duplicate execrh, asmsupt, and u8m/d functions
      for the init text in the Watcom compiled kernel, since they can
      be called "near" in the resident code.
    * portab.h, kernel.asm, main.c, segs.inc:
      Use the "small" model for the init code (split code/data).
    * main.c: Use pointer to MK_FP(0,0x5e0) to save a bit of code.
    * initdisk.c: Move some common code into a "push_ddt" function.
    * sys.c: Correct int25/26 pragmas. Need to explicitly preserve bp
      and pop flags.
    * initdisk.c: fmemcpy->memcpy where possible
    * config.c, init-mod.h, inithma.c, int2f.asm: Make
      UMB_get_largest "pascal". Let it use the xms driver address from
      the HMA code. Misc small config.c cleanups.
    * initdisk.c: "Cache" far drive data table near. Enables elimination
      of many far pointers in initdisk.c. Also clear up the
      unnecessary casts in ConvPartTableEntryToIntern.
    * drivers/getvec.asm, drivers/rdpcclk.asm, drivers/wratclk.asm,
      drivers/wrpcclk.asm, globals.h: Use pascal calling
      conventions for all clock related asm functions.
    * drivers/floppy.asm, dsk.c: Use pascal calling conventions
      for floppy asm functions.
    * init-mod.h, intr.asm, proto.h, kernel.asm: Use the
      pascal calling convention for all intr.asm functions, and let
      them pop the stack (smaller code than using bx). Tell Watcom
      which registers are clobbered; save some more registers for
      intr() -- especially for intr() this helps.
    * device.h, execrh.asm, init-mod.h: Use pascal calling conventions
      for execrh().
    * mkfiles/watcom.mak: Use the "-r" switch for Watcom to preserve ES
      around calls -- saves ~350 bytes.
    * sys.c, init-mod.h, fdkrncfg.c, portab.h, prf.c, proto.h:
      Introduce VA_CDECL: only Turbo C 2.01 needs an explicit cdecl
      for printf, all other compilers can use it with pascal or
      "register" calling conventions.  Saves ~50 bytes for the init code.
    * asmsupt.asm, config.c, init-mod.h: Use strchr and strlen
      more often; also use strchr in the init code.
    * memmgr.c: Better to call fmemset than to do things manually.
    * asmsupt.asm, proto.h, init-mod.h: Be more specific about
      which registers are clobbered by asmsupt.asm functions. Preserve
      "ES" for Watcom.  Saves ~150 bytes resident, ~90 bytes
      nonresident, more for 386 kernels.
      Preserve bx and cx for WATCOMC as well. Saves another 200 bytes.
    * inthndlr.c: Simplify memory access mode check.
    * dsk.c: Remove wrong "512" value for number of root directory
      entries on FAT32 partitions.
    * file.h, sft.h, dosfns.c, fcbfns.c: Get rid of SFT_M* mode
      values. O_* values are sufficient.
    * file.h, fatfs.c: Define O_ACCMODE and use it instead of "3" for
      the open access mask.
    * config.c, init-mod.h: Change default STACKS= size to 256.
    * config.c, init-mod.h, main.c: Remove lpOldTop variable.
      It is no longer necessary (has not been for some time) and the
      assignment in config_init_buffers() was wrong (screwed up fnodes,
      so that buffers overlapped fnodes...).
    * lol.h, config.c, fatfs.c, globals.h, kernel.asm, proto.h:
      Made the main fnodes far so they can be in the HMA.
      Internally the kernel uses two near fnodes though, to save on
      codesize and fmemcpy's if necessary. Having memory management on
      two fnodes is a little silly but I just want to make sure with
      the panic message that we never accidentally try to use three near
      fnodes at the same time (two are used at the same time by rename,
      commit, and merge_file_changes).  This can be cleaned up later.
    * fatfs.c:
      - Merge three almost identical pieces of code used to allocate a new
        directory entry in creat, rename, and mkdir into alloc_find_free.
      - Merge find_fat_free() and extend() -- they were almost
        identical. Have a simplified clause for f_cluster ==
        FREE. Set f_cluster = FREE in shrink_file if the file is set to
        0 bytes; in that case we should set the current cluster to FREE
        even if it is currently a LONG_LAST_CLUSTER.
    * fnode.h, fatdir.c, fatfs.c, lfnapi.c:
      - Eliminate f_back field. extend() now uses f_cluster instead of
        f_back, while map_cluster makes sure it's not set to
        LONG_LAST_CLUSTER (but to the cluster before it) when calling
        extend(). extend() and first_fat() now return the new cluster
        number or LONG_LAST_CLUSTER, just like find_fat_free().
      - Eliminated f_sector and f_boff fields from fnodes.
      - Avoid bitfields for fnodes, using flags instead. Replaced droot
        field by checks for f_dirstart == 0.
      - Make f_diroff an entry offset so it can be 16bits. Enforce the
        65536 entry limit in dir_read(), except for root directories.
	For root directories it's checked against a different limit
	later. Saves 80 bytes or so + 2	bytes in every f_node.
    * dsk.c, fatfs.c, memmgr.c: Remove add_far. adjust_far can do the job.
    * chario.c: Echo input LF as CR-LF unless it's the first
      character. Never store LF in the buffer.
    * memmgr.c, task.c: Eliminated long2para and avoided use of "long"s
      in DosExeLoader, using paragraphs to measure size instead. Saves
      ~130 bytes together.
    * prf.c, asmsupt.asm: Saved ~75 bytes in printf and by elimination of
      fstrlen. There's only one call; inlining doesn't increase the size.
    * dosfns.c, int2f.asm, intr.asm, nls.c: Eliminate intr()
      from resident code. Saves ~200 bytes of HMA resident code.  Also
      made the nls.c functions SS!=DS safe.
    * init-mod.h, inthndlr.c, intr.asm, main.c, proto.h, task.c:
      int21/ah=26: new_psp now copies the old psp and just sets a few
      fields int21/ah=55: child_psp does the rest init code does the
      init (fixed values are always copied now)
    * dosfns.c: Commit each close, even if the ref count is > 0.
    * prf.c: Borland C didn't like one pseudo register use.
    * initdisk.c: Merge "suspect partition" copy/paste code into functions.
    * asmsupt.asm: Save a couple bytes by moving the strncmp_retzero block.
    * fcbfns.c, proto.h: Don't call truename from FcbNameInit(). It
      was only necessary for "FcbRename", which can call it itself.
      Fixes for FcbOpen/FcbFindFirstNext a consequence of
      truename's funny behaviour: truename(c:nul) = c:/nul and
      truename(c:/nul) = c:\nul. Fixes the EJECT problem from Lucho.
      Remove unused variable lpFcb.
    * portab.h, dsk.c, main.c, newstuff.c: Define I386 and I186 more
      cleanly.  Add (UWORD) casts to silence the compiler. Optimize
      (head*sector) to secs_per_cyl. Add BORLANDC to compiler list
      and simplify startup printf to one message.
      #pragma enable_message(130) for Watcom C causes it to
      behave a little more like Borland in terms of warnings.
    * exeflat.c, fatfs.c, fattab.c, fcbfns.c, inthndlr.c,
      memmgr.c, task.c, blockio.c, fatdir.c: Added explicit
      (UWORD) type casts to avoid compiler warnings and sometimes save
      a few bytes too. Also changed the FcbParseFname return value:
      returns offset portion of pointer (SI) instead of the number of
      bytes to be added to SI.
+ Changes Lucho
    * task.c: fixes the CHKDSK I: "Invalid drive specification" bug
    * mcb.h, inthndlr.c: save 33 bytes by eliminating a switch for
      memory/UMB access modes.
    * talloc.c: talloc won't work with MSC (no sbrk or brk available)
      + fix
    * stacks.inc: smaller Protect/Restore 386 register macros.
    * inthndlr.c: Code size reduction and dead code removal.
    * dosnames.c: Remove wrong automatic "*.*" code from Lixing
      Yuan -- return DE_PATHNOTFND or D_NFILES instead
    * ioctl.c: move the lock/unlock simulation of success before the
      device GENIOCTL check so that it applies to any device.
    * filelist, dosnames.h, dosfns.c, dosnames.c, fatdir.c, fatfs.c,
      globals.h, init-mod.h: (with Bart) -- remove the dosnames path
      67 length check. Review the places where it really matters (chdir
      and mkdir).
    * init-mod.h, intr.asm, kernel.asm, main.c, procsupt.asm,
      proto.h, task.c: enable interactive re-execution of the SHELL.
    * nls.h, config.h, globals.h, init-mod.h: move NLS #defines to
      nls.h. Move config structure to config.h. Some cosmetic changes.
    * contrib.txt: From Lucho: update contributors list.
    * config.c: From Lucho: fix EBDA problems with INSTALL. This
      fixes the weird fmemcpy lockup; in reality kernel init code was
      overwritten.
    * asmsupt.asm, config.c, init-mod.h, inithma.c, main.c, makefile,
      prf.c: Use asmsupt string and mem functions for the init code too.
+ Changes Arkady
    * task.c: A few suggestions. Saves 5 bytes.
    * inthndlr.c: Use AL, not AX, for int2f/ax=1213, as per RBIL
    * inthndlr.c: Use xreg struct and macros to optimize the
      int2f/12,4a handler a bit ~25 bytes
    * config.c: Buffer config fixes.
    * inthndlr.c, proto.h: Corrections to int2f/ax=4a01/2.
    * blockio.c: buffer intersection check should use > instead
      of >=. small optimization -- the segment in bp == firstbuf is
      always the same so we just need to compare offsets.
      AllocateHMASpace needs to check FP_SEG(firstbuf) for 0xffff,
      since the buffers may not live in the HMA.
    * *.bat, config.b, kernel/makefile, generic.mak: .BAT file and
      makefile cleanups. Also Lucho reported that nmake/nologo doesn't
      always work in 4dos, but nmake /nologo works.


2004 Jan 31 - Build 2033
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Changes Bart
    * config.c: allow "0" in full-screen config menus and plug a
      few potential related overflows.
    * sys.c: correct sectors/track, head and hidden sector values
      if the boot sector disagrees with the default bpb (unless the
      default bpb says that the number of hidden sectors is zero (usual
      for floppies)).
    * config.c, main.c: Only put PATH= in the environment if
      it's still empty just before executing the shell. This repairs
      SET PATH=.... in config.sys without confusing anyone.
    * fatdir.c, fatfs.c: Fixed bug #1722: dir_close() was
      called for normal files (via map_cluster and find_fat_free). This
      completely messed up rwblock. Removed these calls (for
      directories they are already covered at a higher level) and added
      a few sanity checks to dir_close and dir_write.
    * chario.c, inthndlr.c: Expand tabs for int21/ah=2,9 even
      in raw device modes and if stdout is redirected. This solves bug
      1737 (grep2msg problem)
    * ioctl.c: Adapted from Chris Rodie's patch for bugzilla
      #1730: do a device input status request for int21/ax=4406 for
      devices (not for files). Save ~100 bytes by replacing
      s->sft_flags with flags, s->sft_dev->dh_attr with attr and
      simplifying the if() statement a bit
    * hdr/sft.h, dosfns.c: Adapted from Chris Rodie's patch
      (bugzilla #1729): "open" and "close" should call the open/close
      functions for devices using a device request when appropriate.
    * hdr/fat.h, fatdir.c, fatfs.c, fattab.c, prf.c, proto.h:
      + FAT32 kernels should ignore the upper word of the cluster
        number for FAT16 partitions (just like FAT16 kernels do)
      + added extra checks to make sure that invalid FAT entries are
        never followed
      +	print a message in case of FAT corruption
      + some small optimizations and header cleanups (some suggested by
        Arkady)
    * config.c: Make strupr code unambiguous
    * filelist, sys/makefile, sys/sys.c, sys/talloc.c: ~1K size
      reduction for sys.com by using Tom's talloc.c malloc/free
      functions and using our own filelength for watcomc.
    * initdisk.c: Better (for FAT32) and simpler FAT default
      value calculations.  Also use 16-bit instead of 32-bit quantities
      where possible to save code size. Use a FAT32 table so that FATs
      won't be too big for drives <= 64 GB
    * dosfns.c: Do not clobber the DTA if findfirst or findnext fails.
      Fixes bug #1712
    * fatfs.c: Rename blockio by rqblockio (namespace conflict with dsk.c)
    * inthndlr.c: FAT32 kernels should fail int21/ah=71 with
      al=0, carry set.
    * hdr/portab.h, nls.c: (as reported by Tom) Fix nls upcase problem
      with SS!=DS.
    * fatfs.c: Move permission check to better place (only for
      necessary for opening existing files), not for creating them --
      suggested by Steffen. Force r/o open for FCB and legacy creat
      if the file is read-only
    * fatfs.c: Move common code in media_check() to a new
      blockio() function.
    * fcbfns.c, globals.h, inthndlr.c: Change FcbReadWrite to
      handle multiple records at once; this allows for the optimization
      of FcbRandomBlockIO.
    * fcbfns.c: Divide optimisation (ceiling) + some small cleanups
    * fcbfns.c, globals.h, kernel.asm: Rename the global lpFcb
      variable to sda_lpFcb. Then use local lpFcb variables where
      necessary. This clears up the confusing shadowing.
    * fcbfns.c, inthndlr.c, proto.h: Fix FCB problems with
      int21/ah=27,28 (RandomBlockIO)
    * boot32.asm: jmp -> jmp short (necessary for nasm 0.98)
    * dosfns.c, inthndlr.c, proto.h: Implement support for
      int2f/ax=1220.  Fix int2f/ax=1216 (needs sft handles, not psp
      handles, and to return the relative handle in BX, and to deal
      with carry)
    * boot.asm: Fix problem with FAT12
+ Changes Eric Luttmann <ecl@users.sourceforge.net>:
    * main.c: Fix for multisegmented device drivers: If there are multiple
      device drivers in a single driver file, only the END ADDRESS
      returned by the last INIT call should be the used.  It is
      recommended that all the device drivers in the file return the
      same address.  This fixes a load problem with DUSE.
    * config.c, init-mod.h, main.c: fix for multi-segment device
      drivers; preserve rq_endaddr between init calls for the same driver.
+ Changes Lucho:
    * inthndlr.c: Remove AL=0 check for AH=6c (from Arkady) Optimize DL check.
    * main.c, serial.asm: (with some help from Tom):
      initialize serial ports and retry serial reads on timeout.
    * sys.c, boot.asm, boot32.asm, boot32lb.asm:
      SYS 3.0 changes: added /L parameter to SYS to be able to change
      the kernel boot segment + a few boot sector changes to get the
      pointer at the same magic place for all boot sectors.
    * makefile: clean up *.lnk files for "clean" and "clobber".
    * dsk.c: the DJ mechanism needs to affect MEM 0050h:0004h - MS-DOS
      LOGICAL DRIVE FOR SINGLE-FLOPPY SYSTEM (A: / B:) Size:BYTE
    * int2f.asm, generic.mak: basic implementation of INT 2F/ax=4a33 -
      CHECK MS-DOS VERSION 7; necessary for SpinRite (Steve Gibson)
    * inthndlr.c: implement int2f/ax=1211 NORMALIZE ASCIZ FILENAME
    * config.c, init-mod.h, main.c: Added SET support to config.sys


2003 Sep 24 - Build 2032a
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Changes Bart
    * fix segment problems with ctrl-c and character uppercase
      handlers
    * fix critical error callers to set the critical error code
      immediately before calling the handler (in case they call
      DOS-59); don't set the critical error in inthndlr.c if
      something else already did. Return with an errorcode if
      "truename" and "read"/"write" encountered a critical error.
    * sys.c: add /k kernname.sys option to and straighten out SYS option
      processing; remove the metakern magic.
    * config.c: ignore the segment part for multi-part device drivers


2003 Sep 21 - Build 2032
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Changes Rune Espeseth <re@icd.no> (modified by Bart)
    * config.txt, config.c: Full screen config.sys menus (use MENUCOLOR=)
+ Changes Michal Bakowski (mb@orad.pl)
    * initdisk.c, kernel.asm: Change the boot drive to always
      be C: if DLASortByDriveNo==1
+ Changes Arkady
    * dsk.c: Use memcpy instead of fmemcpy; avoid downcasting
      from far to near.
    * sysclk.c: err if sizeof(struct ClockRecord) != rp->r_count
      move year init below reading the BIOS
    * main.c: init_device corrections/cleanups
    * device.h: Change r_status and dh_name to unsigned quantities.
    * task.c: Free memory if there is an error in the relocation
      table.
    * floppy.asm, getvec.asm, rdatclk.asm, rdpcclk.asm, wrpcclk.asm:
      driver .asm files optimizations (also from Bart); remove
      obsolete rdatclk.
    * build.txt: Fix some typos.
    * inthndlr.c: Add missing (); small optimization for DosGetdate/time.
+ Changes Lucho
    * boot.asm, boot32.asm, boot32lb.asm, sys.c: add metakern support:
      sys looks for a file metakern.sys which is a multiple of 512.
    * break.c: Fix ctrl-break bug.
    * ioctl.c: IOCTL 4406 provided reverse AL output on regular
      files - FF if EOF, 0 if not. It should output 0 if EOF, FF if not.
    * initclk.c: Initclk changes
    * config.c, init-mod.h, initoem.c: Support for
      switches=/e[[:]nnnn] and for moving the EBDA
    * fatfs.c: Use 0x10000UL (avoids Turbo C warning)
    * sys.c: Move manually added "RCS" entries to the CVS log.
    * main.c: Adjustments for MSVC.
    * ioctl.c: int21/ax=440d lock/unlock logical/physical volume
      simulate success for MS-DOS 7+ SCANDISK etc. --LG
    * main.c: && should be || in check for \, / and :
    * task.c: Adjust registers used when starting programs. Some
      demos expect undocumented values (with Bart).
    * mscl8.mak: Forgotten HMA_TEXT for MS compilers.
    * sys.c: Add lock/unlock drive to SYS
    * history.txt: Changelog correction.
    * fatfs.c: Use near bpb on the stack in bpb_to_dpb.  Make
      sure the number of FAT sectors is actually enough to hold that
      many clusters. Otherwise back the number of clusters down
    * procsupt.asm, proto.h, task.c: Don't disable a20 for
      "exit" int21/ah=4c
+ Changes Lucho, Tom, Eric
    * boot.asm, boot32.asm, boot32lb.asm, makefiles, sys.c:
      * boot.asm modified to support non-512 byte sectors
        (e.g. 1.2 MB NEC diskettes)
      * 512 byte sector size check removed (although Eric's boot32ea.asm
        does require 512-byte sectors, all LBA FAT32 volumes have
        512-byte sectors anyway).
      * boot.asm cleaned up and modified to support Metakern
        bsDriveNumber updated by SYS even #ifndef STORE_BOOT_INFO
      * (nothing in common)
      *  SYS Now supports and includes the following new boot sectors:
        1) the combined CHS+LBA FAT12/FAT16 boot sector by Tom Ehlert(29 July)
        2) the CHS-only FAT32 boot sector -- as patched by Jon Gentle(08 July)
        3) the LBA-only FAT32 boot sector by Eric Auer and Jon Gentle (19 July)
      * The old combined (CHS+LBA), no-CALCPARAMS, no-resizable, non-Ghostable,
        non-standard FAT32 boot sector and STORE_BOOT_INFO is no longer used.
      * dump_sector() showed ASCII debug printout for the old sector
        only - fixed.
      * Put a boot sector only if sector size= 512 (may it not be so in
        Japan?!). If non-512 byte sectors encountered, report to the
        fd-kernel mailing list.
      * Now puts boot sector before copying kernel/shell so it works in
        WinNT now.
      * check_space() now implemented at last (required significant
        modifications)
      * New (FAT type) detection method according to a MS White Paper.
      * Now BOOTONLY works even without preceding boot sector image file name.
      * Some minor code cleanups.
      * Bart: some cleanups to the above; replaced 386 code for CHS FAT32
        by 8088 code. Use boot32lb.asm instead of boot32ea.asm
+ Changes Bart
    * portab.h, process.h, init-mod.h, inithma.c, kernel.asm, main.c, task.c:
      * add support for the far jmp at "int 30" (0000:00c0)
      * mirror it for the HMA (ffff:00d0)
      * put all DOS int handler (and the CPM entry jumped to from
        int30) jumpers in the "CONST" portion of DGROUP (instead of
	LGROUP)	This helps Turbo C++ 1.01 make with the -S (swap)
	switch.
      * adjustments to set the relevant PSP fields in task.c
    * blockio.c: Always use huge block sectors if the relevant bit is
      set in the device header. This solves a problem with xmsdsk.
    * chario.c: Small optimizations
    * clobber.bat: Remove duplicate clobber.
    * Flip some slashes for Linux compat and simplifications in makefiles
    * device.h, portab.h: Use STATIC=static for watcom C (statics
      are in the mapfile); remove some cruft.
    * makefile, wlinker.bat: More verbose mapfiles for watcom
      C; some slash preparations to allow cross-building on Linux
    * exeflat.c, patchobj.c: Fix warnings reported by Turbo C
    * break.c, chario.c, dosfns.c, globals.h, inthndlr.c,
      proto.h, systime.c: (with a little help from Arkady)
      Simplifications and cleanups.
      Pass a near pointer to the far pointer that points to the device
      instead of an SFT index (in general).
      Make cooked_write much faster by only testing for input every 32
      characters.  No longer test for ctl_s on syscon if writing to
      the printer: just read from the printer which will return zero
      characters.  Fix reading/writing zero characters by returning
      "256" (special code). Adjust interfaces in other files.
    * portab.h: New UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER macro that appears to
      work for all compilers.
    * floppy.asm: Remove unused code.
    * init-mod.h: Solve compilation problem with Borland C++ 3.1
    * config.b: "-p" is no longer necessary in config.bat
    * kernel.asm: Add necessary "BootHardDiskSeconds" for non
      UPXed kernels.
    * chario.c, dosfns.c: Add necessary casts to ? : constructions;
      cleanup read_line_handle a little.
    * portab.h: Add peek and poke #defines
    * chario.c: Fix pointer overflow problem for reading line using handle.
    * makefiles, exeflat.c Clean cleans a bit more; change () to (void)
    * main.c: Set the PSP before the DTA. This solves an interrupt
      vector table corruption.
    * kernel.asm: Use "local" (instead of "global") disable/enable
      A20. This solves the problems with NIOS.
    * asmsupt.asm, misc.c, proto.h, strings.c: Remove (unused) strncpy.


2003 Jul 19 - Build 2031
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Changes Luchezar Georgiev
    * (with Bart) add extra low disk buffer to avoid HMA
      problems with certain device drivers.
    * Add an extra space character at the end of the command line
      for device drivers to prevent wrong behavior at empty command line.
    * point to a correct environment for INSTALL=
      (fixes problems with xmsdsk).
    * change device driver error code check (using S_ERROR | S_DONE)
      (fixes problem with the SystemSoft PCMCIA socket services driver)
    * correct parameter order in inthndlr.c, chario.c
    * INSTALLHIGH correction.
+ Changes Tom
    * Fix a problem with the 'BootFromHarddiskIfNoKeyHit' option.
      that occurred with some Compaq and Fujitsu/Siemens highend equipment.

    * config.txt updates
+ Changes Steffen Kaiser
    * NLS adjustments
+ Changes Bart
    * Correct problem with multiple UMBs (bug #1671)

      maximum of 20.
    * Make "unable to disable A20" message #ifdef DEBUG only.
    * config.c,main.c: Small size optimizations (some proposed by
      Arkady Belousov)
    * asmsupt.asm: Removed unnecessary jcxz's (Arkady)
    * intr.asm: intr() cleanup and small optimizations (Arkady)
    * Use PASCAL calling convention by default for Turbo compilers.
    * Move more externs to header files
    * SFT init cleanup (+3 files need to be low)
    * config.c, main.c: Fix bug in block device driver init of
      DPBs (bug #1969, TDSK problem)


2003 Jun 18 - Build 2030
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Changes Tom
    * if user left accidentally floppy or CD in drive,
      give him a chance to continue to boot from HD.
      disabled by default, enablable by SYS CONFIG
      (BOOTHARDDISKSECONDS)
+ Changes Lixing Yuan
    * dosnames.c cleanup, fix for truename if the filename
      contains wildcards and a trailing dot.
+ Changes Eric Auer
    * add sanity check to initdisk.c for (driveParam->chs.Sector == 0)
      + some display tweaks
    * add EECHO (echo with $=ESC) support to the config.sys parser.
    * distinguish between the builtin DOS version and the settable
      DOS version.
    * console.asm now accepts extended scancodes (modified by Bart, fixes
      bug #1657)
    * added BOOTONLY option to SYS (modified by Bart)
+ Changes David Bolen
    * add support for UNC-style paths (that start with "\\")
+ Changes Luchezar Georgiev
    * add Bulgarian country structure data
+ Changes Bart
    * flip some slashes in drivers/*.asm
      (enables cross-assembly on Linux)
    * remove superfluous printf("\n") in patchobj.c
    * combine the INIT class with the CODE class (classes can span
      multiple physical segments)
    * re-add _TEXT to LGROUP to be able to simplify the patchobj magic
    * don't specify -zPI_GROUP for the init code in Borland compilers
      (unnecessary, it will be put there because of segs.inc)
    * remove STDPATCH; it is no longer necessary
    * add FILESHIGH, LASTDRIVEHIGH, and STACKSHIGH and DOSDATA=UMB
      to load these structures into UMBs
    * make DOS sub-MCBs visible (seen by MEM)
    * preliminary allocation of FILES etc. now takes place at the
      top of conventional memory, and device drivers are loaded before
      the final allocation takes place.
    * handle multiple UMBs more correctly (but config.sys can use
      only one UMB for devicehigh -- /Ln,xxxx is not yet implemented)
    * minor size optimizations in newstuff.c, chario.c, dosfns.c and fcbfns.c.
      asmsupt.asm: correct fmemchr (all n's) and *memset/*memcpy
      (n==0)
    * introduce lol structure for list of lists; avoid lots of
      relocations
    * avoid more relocations in the asm files by loading ds from
      [cs:_DGROUP_]
    * Fix problem with attributes with the volume label bit + findnext
    * SYS: avoid copying kernel.sys and command.com if the destination
      is identical to the source (fixes bug #1656).
    * Fix bug in DeleteBlockInBufferCache: needs to make the block
      invalid, not flush it, if we're writing (bug #1635).
    * added switches=/k/n/f support to the config.sys parser.


2003 Mar 14 - Build 2029
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Changes Tom
    * fattab.c, fat.h removed the wrong ELSE_ISFAT32()
    * fatfs.c: rmdir would crash if you rmdir'ed an existing file
    * config.c, main.c, portab.h
      implement INSTALL and INSTALLHIGH for config.sys
      basic COUNTRY=xxx support (with a little help from others,
      mentioned in config.c)
    * execrh.asm: save si, di for strategy device driver handler
    * (adjusted by Bart): the internal "truename" has to reject
      wildcards for all commands except for the exposed "truename"
      (DosTrueName, int21/ah=60), FindFirst and FCB functions.
+ Changes Bart
    * add top level makefile with list of files to zip for releases
    * remove obsolete documentation and intr.h
    * eliminated the "f_highwater" fnode field.
    * reintroduced HMA_TEXT segment and adjust segments in libm.lib
      to solve problems with Borland compilers.


2002 Dec 9 - Build 2028
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Changes Tom
    * move clock driver initialization to inittext
    * new ELSE_ISFAT16 macro to save some bytes
    * use _TEXT for old HMA_TEXT, _LOWTEXT for old _TEXT to get
      a slightly less complicated memory model from the C compiler's
      point of view.
    * add support for int2f/4a01,4a02: query/allocate HMA space.
    * updated config.txt
+ Changes Arkady V. Belousov
    * slightly improved asm for print_hex and int2f clear_ax stuff
    * use #error for unknown compilers
    * remove hexDigits reference
    * correct comment in kernel.asm (pad to 05fdh)
+ Changes Bart
    * fix ss:sp init bug for int21/ax=4b01 (visible in DEBUG)
    * fix redirection problem for character output routines
    * fix press the any key message for floppy swaps
    * correct cluster value for BAD cluster
    * correct FAT12/16/32 cutoff magic values as per the MS spec
    * the BUFFERS structure is now the same as in MSDOS 5+ and uses
      a circular double-linked list using near pointers.
    * move all old RCS log messages into one seperate file
    * divide the fnode f_cluster_offset field by the size of a cluster:
      this gives a more efficient map_cluster().
    * point the CharMapSrvc pointer to the DOS DS for AARD compliance.
    * nls.c: set CX to cooperate with load_unf.exe


2002 Nov 9 - Build 2027
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Changes Tom
    * memset ErrorAlreadyPrinted to 0 in config.c
+ Changes Bart
    * reset drive before and after int26 in SYS for winnt compatibility
    * propagate sharing bits correctly in DosOpen
    * return DE_NFILES if a volume label is not found; search for volume
      label if attr & 8 not just if attr==8
    * initialize the critical error code to 0 in inthndlr.c
    * ignore value of DH for extended open int21/ah=6c
    * fix problem with NULL device code being in the wrong segment
    * Hopefully innocent hack to deal with NDN in ioctl.c (ignore upper bits
      of the drive number)
    * use subst bit 15 for int21/ax=4409(IOCTL-CHECK IF BLOCK DEVICE REMOTE).


2002 Oct 27 - Build 2027rc
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Changes Bart
    * reorganized chario.c, got F1-F6, Ins, Del, etc. working
    * fixed bug in extended open
    * fixed bug in memory manager (realloc should try to defragment;
      UMB fixes)
    * consistently pass sft_idx around for all SFT functions (instead of
      the far pointer)
    * lpUserStack is gone :)
    * Idle interrupt: now uses disk i/o stack instead of error stack if it
      re-enters DOS; can not be called from int21/ah=3f. It also checks
      InDos now (as documented in "undocumented dos").
    * int21/ah=59 should use the disk i/o stack, not the character stack.
    * get_cds: a uniform way to get the CDS for drive X which can do error
      checking too. get_dpb: similar.
    * task.c uses mid-level system file handles instead of PSP handles.
    * SFT sequence is MS/DR DOS like: 0=AUX 1=CON 2=PRN
    * int21/ah=4d needs to clear the return code after returning it.
    * Removed need for "unusedretval" because some functions return a long int
      now.
    * Do not warn for some additional LBA partition layouts (begin/end
      cylinder=1023) in initdisk.c.
    * support int2f/ax=1213 (uppercase character) (ASCII only for now).
    * fix for top of memory parameter to device driver - fixes problem
      with DRDOS emm386
    * eliminated printf for non-init code -- use put_unsigned and
      put_string instead
    * better MK_FP for Turbo C++ 1.01 and later
    * PSP related task.c cleanups
    * use --best and new upx (1.23) for binary build
    Changes Tom and Bart:
    * Use Pascal calling convention for memcpy and friends in asmsupt.asm
    * Fixed make temp file
    * fix bug in DosFindNext
    * misc makefile fixes


2002 Aug 3 - Build 2027test
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Changes Tom
    * enable LBA FAT16 booting
    * workaround for redirectors that do/do not set the opencount
    * int25/26 should fail for redirectors
    * set the number of sectors per track in the INT 1E table when
      reading/writing floppies
    * disabled fatal() in error.c
    * Disable the A20 line upon exec (int21/ah=4B). This is necessary for some
      brain-dead exepacked programs.
    * removed unnecessary "BUFFERS" fields
    * proper check for network/non-existing drive for int25/26.
    * save more bytes on the stack at various places
    * made the local registers for inthndlr.c "near" instead of "far".
    * fix bug in strchr handling for fcbfns.c (FcbParseFname)
+ Changes Steffen (but changed a lot by Bart)
    * new truename (Bart: but without mapPath() style struct)
    * merge open/create functions into one extended open function
    * also honor the sharing bits better for "open"
    * use local 8+3 path names in fatfs.c; merge name+extension
      into one array
    * take care of filenames that start with ASCII 5: they should be
      treated as starting with 0xe5
    * exploit the fact that the filenames are already "truenames",
      i.e., fully qualified in fatfs.c. This simplifies parsing a lot.
+ Changes Bart
    * make "if exist c:\dir\nul" working
    * honor "do not inherit handle on exec" flag for "open".
    * improve the FCB functions so that they set the critical error code
      properly
    * next_cluster returns "1" instead of DE_xxx in case of failure.
    * create one function to do binary character IO (used for CLOCK$
      driver and character drivers such as CON)
    * better handling of ABORT/FAIL
    * merge all read and write functions
    * patchobj makefile correction
    * printf uses va_list etc.
    * quicker and more robust Watcom build
    * use FS: and GS: for Watcom 386.
    * workaround: don't use DL for floppy boots, but fixed A:
    * disable unused functions in floppy.asm
    * cleaner prototypes (thanks to gcc)
    * reorganized ioctl.c; there was an uninitialized variable.
    * inlined some functions of fattab.c
    * added (f)strcmp, (f)memcmp and (f)memchr to asmsupt.asm
    * initially suggested by Arkady: dsk.c FS_info copy optimization
    * initialize a VDISK signature in the HMA
    * sysclk.c: small size optimization
    * small UMB fixes
    * made the CDS into a proper array instead of a structure with
      one member
    * large task.c cleanups -
      merge as much as possible from DosExeLoader and DosComLoader
      (from Tom:) eliminate some structures in low memory
    * main.c: slightly cleanup "SHELL=" line parsing.


2002 May 9 - Build 2026b
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Changes Tom
    * limit output at boot time somewhat
    * GetCurrentDirectory should fail, if drive is accessible
    * fixed some minor config.sys parser bugs and have the possibility
      of things like 123?device=EMM386.EXE NOEMS
    * shorter version of DosMemLargest()
+ Changes Bart
    * repaired makefile dependencies
    * implemented multi-sector writes, and re-merged
      readblock()/writeblock() into rwblock ()
    * implemented int21/ah=1c for network drives (RHIDE needs this)
    * initialize current_ldt for findnext (hinted by Steffen)
    * check serial number for floppy disk changes where the drive
      does not feature a changeline
    * reset to root directory when floppy has changed
    * cleaned up endian helpers {get,put}{byte,word,long}
    * don't close file if disk is full
    * enforce minimum of 9 sectors per track for INT1E (necessary for
      some floppies on some XTs)
    * clear carry when calling INT23 (ctrl-break handler) as per RBIL
    * don't copy FCBs on exec if they are pointed to by FFFF:FFFF.
    * resolved warnings for  Watcom (now compiles with -wx -we)
    * truename fix (return DE_FILENOTFND for foo.bar.foo)
+ Changes Jeremy
    * fixed SYS _dos_getdrive for non-Borland compilers
+ Changes Tom and Bart
    * cleaned up fatfs.c, fattab.c, sysclk.c (CLOCK$ driver), systime.c


2002 Feb 17 - Build 2026a
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Changes Martin
    * fixed SYS for non-Watcom compilers
+ Changes Tom
    * set CONFIG environment variable to selected number of CONFIG.SYS
      menu entry, for example for use in AUTOEXEC.BAT.
+ Changes Bart
    * fixed FCBOpen
    * network redirector fixes ; it appears that clearing CF before calling
       the redirector is safer than setting CF
    * allow creating, renaming and deleting volume labels using FCBs
    * fix renaming with wildcards using FCBs
    * some dosfns.c and fcbfns.c clean-ups
    * booting from hard disk now always sets the default drive to C:,
      not D: if booting from the second physical hard disk, etc (bug #1062).


2002 Feb 9 - Build 2026
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Changes Tom
    * fixed various typos, #includes
+ Changes Bart
    * fixed ECHO in config.sys
    * made passing parameters to command.com more robust:
      zero commandline before use, fixed buffer overflow for F5+F8
    * "uppermem_root" in the List of Lists is now FFFF if no UMBs
      available, as documented in RBIL
    * removed all direct hooks from init_text to hma_text; duplicated
      the remaining functions (memset, memcpy and friends).
    * bumped up default DOS version of FAT32 enabled kernel to 7.10


2002 Feb 3 - Build 2026test
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Changes Tom
    * FCB clean-ups and fixes (bug in FCB Random IO,
      CYRUS CHESS, bug #1014)
    * initial config.sys menus (see config.txt)
    * execrh.asm: construct 'interrupt' address after strategy to avoid
      some issues with non-trivial 'strategy' routines.
    * make kernel UPX-able
    * cleaned up midnight flag, dates
    * tmark() and friends are floppy specific and implemented in C
      instead of ASM (parts by Bart)
    * DMA boundary checking gives the right number of sectors if
      the start sector is 512-bytes-aligned.
+ Changes Victor
    * lfn fixes (lfn is only a place holder, does not work yet)
    * FAT32 fixes
    * dosemu log nicer
+ Changes Martin
    * log output
    * warning fixes for sys, patchobj and prf.c
+ Changes Bart
    * FCB clean-ups and fixes

    * implement ioctl get/set logical drive map (int21/ax=440E--F)
    * implement get address of drive data table (int2f/ax=0803)
    * fix "get address of SDA" (int21/ax=5d06)
    * do not use CHS if the root extended partition of the relevant
      logical partition is labelled LBA (bug #1011)
    * hopefully avoid format problem (bug #1030) by not setting drive
      to "non-accessible" while reading the bpb.
    * boot sector fixes:
      enable booting beyond cylinder x where x * number of heads >= 65536.
      still uses CHS to boot (not able to boot beyond cylinder 1023)
      recognize FF8-FFF as FAT12 ending (was only FFF) (bug #1021)
    * avoid using LIB when linking the kernel by echo-ing to a linker
      resource file. Use a batch file to bypass Borlands Make 2.0
      unwillingness to redirect stdout.
    * UMB variable clean-up
    * use of "const" for constant global variables
    * reduced size of Watcom-compiled SYS binary


2001 Nov 18 - Build 2025c
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Changes Bart
    * ran source code .c and .h files through "indent"
    * fixed new printf bug
    * removed some duplicate documents
+ Changes Victor & Bart
    * fixed sys.c fat32 detection bug (offset 0x10, not 0x2c)


2001 Nov 17 - Build 2025b
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Changes Tom
    * fix a few more batch file and makefile details
    * fix problems with command line editing: F1 and right key
    * string merging in dosnames.c
    * optimizations for MSC
+ Changes Bart
    * fix readblock problem not properly detecting EOF - it sometimes
      returned an error where it should just report a short count.
      Also fnp->f_offset==0 is not a special case for blockread
      (neither should it be for write - but that'll be for later)
      For both cases it's perfectly legal to do a seek first.
    * fix writeblock not setting highwater to offset when doing a
      truncate (count == 0)
    * hopefully now really fix the floppy change problem -
      dsk.c: getbpb() should query changeline BEFORE reading the BPB.
    * fixed warnings from WATCOM compiler - one of them was in fact
      a bug in fcbfns.c
    * started big clean-up
      - converted obsolete bcopy(), sncopy() and friends to memcpy(),
        strncpy() etc.
      - removed $Log entries that are also on the CVS server and
        removed the $ so no new entries will be added in files.
      indenting will be next - other fixes will be buried in diffs if
      I do that now.


2001 Nov 12 - Build 2025a
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Changes Tom
    * initialize LBA parameter struct to 0's - some BIOSes don't fill
      in everything. Thanks to Bernd Blaauw's bug report.
    * Minor boot sector optimization.
    * added some exeflat options
+ Changes Jeremy
    * changes to fdkrncfg.c: mostly cosmetic to the output
    * added sys.doc file (updated by Bart)
+ Changes Bart
    * let int 0 (divide by zero) and int 6 (invalid opcode) print a
      stack trace to aid in debugging
    * fixed floppy drive detection for XT's.
    * fixed bug in int21/ah=0x32 and friends - we should flush data before the
      forced media_check
    * Use CHS addressing if possible on partitions with the relevant ID,
      you can overide this using the new FORCELBA and GLOBALENABLELBASUPPORT
      sys config options.
    * Always use BIOS values for translating LBA to CHS for fixed disks -
      ignoring the boot sector values. For floppies the boot sector is used.
    * fixed "truename hello." to remove the trailing dot.
    * added options to SYS to write to a boot sector image file
    * set Critical Error Code for ioctl's
    * fake cluster size for 64k clusters just like FAT32 for INT21/AH=0x36
      and friends.
+ Changes Bart+Tom+Victor
    * make makefile system more robust
+ Changes Victor
    * cleaned up map_cluster and dir_read (bug fixed by Bart)
    * updated LFN API (in development, not used yet)


2001 Nov 4 - Build 2025a (test)
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Changes tom
    * config.sys processing: placing ? on the left side of '=' like
	 ?device=  or device ?=
	 asks for this single line
      fill the available HMA with buffers
    * added kernel configuration options to sys.com, small area at 60:xx
      (in cooperation with Jeremy)	
    * readblock optimized to read as many data as possible in one
      int13 request - great speedups for large reads
    * some more SDA variables need to be updated for the network
      redirector (the sft index)
    * reduce stack usage in task.c, fattab.c, ioctl.c, execrh.asm, inthndlr.c
    * protect high part of 32-bit registers (stacks.inc)
    * moved copyright messages to init data to save a bit of memory
    * added relocinf, patchobj, sorted + some more output of exeflat
    * UMB fixes
+ Fixes Bart, Victor, Tom
    * more FAT32 fixes - to work with device drivers
    * fixed overflow problem with more than 2048 directory entries
    * various space saving changes, dir_init_fnode
+ Changes Bart, Tom
    * many makefile changes to enable compilation with different
      compilers (MS, Watcom, Borland). Watcom compiles but the result
      does not run yet.
+ Changes Bart
    * extended the double-byte lead table from int21/ah=63 to 4 zeros
      to make Watcom happy
    * support for IOCTL AX=440D, CL=40,41,42,61,62 for
      read/write/format track - this enables R. Nordier format to work
    * default floppy type depends on the drive
    * rewrote many parts of int2f.asm to have a cleaner remote_xxx
      interface with less code and stack usage.
    * limit for int21/ah=36 is FFF6 total/free sectors
    * made the rtc clock reading code a bit more robust - assumes
      there is no rtc if the returned date is zero
    * removed non-necessary code in dosnames.c because we're always
      dealing with a TRUENAME there
    * added zero extending of files, but removed it (unless you force
      it) since MSDOS doesn't zero-extend files either
    * wrote a source for exeflat, removed all binaries from the source
    * added more INT2F/AH=12 functions to solve some MSCDEX issues
    * changed BAD sector handling : only ....FF7 is recognized as BAD,
      but FORMAT information from initdisk will only give ....FEF as
      the largest cluster (for safety), so ....FF0-....FF6 are not used
      for newly formatted disks (here .... is either nothing, F, or
      FFFF, FAT12/FAT16/FAT32).
    * more fatfs/fatdir clean-ups - now unnecessary fields dfull,
      dremote and dsize removed from fnodes.


2001 Sep 24 - Build 2025
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Fixes Victor
    * More FAT32 fixes
+ Fixes Tom
    * Printer handling
    * misc INT2F/AH=12 fixes.
    * misc clean-ups
+ Fixes Bart
    * Added drive B: handling if only one floppy drive available
      (look for play_dj() in dsk.c)
    * Simplify Victor's FAT32 fixes a bit
    * More printer clean-ups
    * fixed sys (thanks Jeremy)
    * DosChangeDir fails for path name too long.
+ Fixes Jeremy
    * Changed SYS so if no source given or only source drive (no path)
      given, then checks for kernel.sys & command.com in current
      path (of current drive or given drive) and if not there
      uses root (but only if source & destination drive are different).
      Fix printf to include count(ret) if copy can't write all requested bytes


2001 Sep 22 - Build 2025 (test)
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Added Victor
    * FAT32 support (credits to Martin Stromberg for boot32.asm optimizations)
    * Delete long file names if short file name given
+ Added Jeremy
    * modified SYS so it takes optional 2nd parameter (similar to PC DOS)
      where if only 1 argument is given, assume to be destination drive,
      but if two arguments given, 1st is source (drive and/or path)
      and second is destination drive
+ fixes Victor
    * some small FCB and dsk.c fixes
+ fixes Tom
    * some FAT32 issues
    * many compiler portability changes (compiles with Watcom, MSC, ...)
    * DosMemChange should set the PSP
    * converted INT2F/AH=12 functions to C and added some - enough to
      get most of the MS LAN network client working
+ fixes Bart
    * some FAT32 issues
    * Dos{Open,Creat}Sft drive letter issues
       for CDROMs (thanks Jeremy)
    * shrink_file should ALWAYS fail for directories, also with
      dos_set_fattr (thanks Jeremy)
    * only give warnings for slightly suspect partitions at boot
      time where CHS does not match LBA.
    * re-enabled copyright notice.
    * some dsk.c clean-ups to avoid DIR giving the same contents for
      a different floppy (get serial number/volume label did reset the
      changed state).
    * attribute should be 8-bit fix


2001 Aug 19 - Build 2024/h
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ fixes Bart
    * truename fixes (#580)
    * free space fixes (#249)
    * Ctrl-C/Ctrl-Break fix


2001 Aug 19 - Build 2024/g
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ fixes Bart
    * set file time fixes
    * clock fixes
    * findfirst/next fixes
    * added a bit more int2f/ax=12xx functionality
    * buffers trick to fool MFT so that it does not crash
    * Ctrl-S (pause) and Ctrl-P (printer echo) now work.
      Ctrl-Q is ignored by DOS.
    * FCB "closing twice is legal" fix. Necessary for visicalc.
+ fixes Bart + Tom
    * fixed shsucdx /u unloading problem	


2001 Jul 28 - Build 2024/f
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ fixes Bart
    * fixed get current directory - MSCDEX works now (always)
    * initdisk.c correctly sets number of hidden sectors: necessary
      for FORMAT - SYS chain to work
+ updates Bart
    * initialisation memory situation changed: kernel is loaded
      to the top of conventional memory in the beginning. Then
      move it back low or high depending on DOS=HIGH and the presence
      of an XMS driver.
      DOS=HIGH without an XMS driver (such as FDXMS) has no effect anymore!
+ fixes Tom, Victor, Bart
    * various fatfs.c fixes and clean ups


2001 Jul 23 - Build 2024/e
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ fixes Tom
    * dyninit allocation fix
    * various clean ups
+ fixes Bart
    * #define DBLBYTE in inhndlr.c. Necessary for PQDI
    * FCB corrections and cleanups (with a little help from Tom)
    * cleaned up (FCB)FindFirst/FindNext a little more.
    * task.c: copies default FCBs, initializes AX properly and
      an int21/ax=4b01 fix. Also closes all FCB opened files upon
      termination of a program.
    * dosnames.c: fixed DJGPP "ls c:/" problem reported by Martin
+ fixes Victor Vlasenko
    * Makefile fix for dealing with Borland make 3.6
    * fix for fatfs.c shrink_file()
+ fixes Bart
    * handle B: just like A: on a single floppy system. There still needs to be
      user interaction like "Please put a floppy in drive B:".
    * ioctl.c fix for INT21/AX=4400 + sft driveno field
    * various small fcb fixes
    * put file position number and pointers to Pri/SecPathName into
      SDA. Now MSCDEX works as redirector (but still not always :-()
    * redirector set attribute fixes + various cleanups
    * truename+attr+ioctl fix => DJGPP libc compiles cleanly!
+ changes Bart
    * use the output of truename() consistently: this saves a lot of
      headaches in parsing later and also allows a lot of simplifying:
      made many parameters in fatfs.c and fatdir.c NEAR
+ added Bart
    * partly implemented the "Drive Data Table" see RBIL INT2f/AX=0803
    * implemented construction of default BPB in initdisk.c
    * implemented the access flag in dsk.c
    * printf writes to DOSEMU log if prf.c compiled with #define DOSEMU
+ fixes Bart
    * dsk.c uses default BPB in the right places (with help from Tom and Brian)
    * Brian's FORMAT now works
    * Tab fix (bug reported by Martin Stromberg)
    * INT21/AH=0x1f now simply uses AH=0x32 for the default drive
+ fixes Tom
    * saved some static variables
    * implementation of int_2f_111e_call() for network/LAN manager
    * return AX=0001 for default redirector handler
    * enable use of multiple UMBs
    * fixed task.c 'LOADHIGH executables': minAlloc == maxAlloc = 0
      and an fixed overwriting the MCB


2001 Jul 9 - Build 2024/d
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ fixes Bart:
    * fixed Ctrl-C (Ctrl-S and Ctrl-Q still missing).
    * ioctl EOF fix (DJGPP less&gdb problem reported by Martin Stromberg)
    * INT21/AH=29 (Parse Filename into FCB) fix (NC problem reported
      by Ken Martwick) with clean up from Tom.
    * ioctl should do a media_check before calling the block driver:
      this fixes bug #726 (first dir gave serial no. 1234-5678).
    * initdisk.c now uses the init data segment.
+ fixes Tom:
    * fixes for INT21/AH=32; this should cure the problems with
      Brian's new format.
    * more SYS fixes.
+ added Tom:
    * some more diagnostics (123) to aid finding bugs when booting from
      a hard disk.

from 2001 jun 23 : KE2024BP

+ fixes Tom:
    * FAT FS: would not expand files correctly, if lseek()
      beyond EOF (see also relnotes.txt)
    * FcbFindFirst/Next made compatible with MSDOS CHKDSK
    * saved even more bytes (now 24 buffers in HMA :-)

from KE2024BM
+ added Tom:
    * a mechanism, to regain near data (like miarray, bpbarray,...)
      this is somewhat braindamaging, moving the kernel up and down,
      working with different CS/DS combinations, but somehow working, :-)
      miarray allocated, using this mechanism.
    * made f_nodes near (2 K saving in HMA_TEXT)
      this technic might as well applied to CDs, DPB, sft's, ...
      this even saves a few bytes on stack :-)

from 2001 May 21: Build2024L
+ Fixes  Tom:
    * Clustersize 64K made working (one small ULONG was missing)
    * check for drive existence for INT25/26
    * NDEV = max number of possible harddisk partitions bumped
      from 8 to 20 (my testconfiguration has 13)

+ Added  tom:
    * LBA support for disks > 8GB (with the help from Brian
    Reifsnyder, see also relnotes.txt)
    * moved initialization for DISK (partition scanning) to INIT_CODE


2001 Jun 2 - Build 2024
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Fixes  Tom:
    * small fixes again.
    * one possible cause for data corruption (BFR_VALID) detected
    * directories with 'ARCHIVE' attribute could not be deleted
    * saved even more bytes (now 20 buffers in HMA :-)
    * some issues with pathnames around PARSE_MAX removed
    * blanks in filenames weren't proper handled
    * there was (at rare circumstances) a buffer overflow
      while config.sys parsing.
+ Fixes  Bart:
    * INT 21 0A - Dos Buffered Input reworked
    * init_PSPSet() fix for setting the PSP
+ Added  tom:
    * slighly better buffer handling (search BFR_UNCACHE)
      now go more FAT+DIR sectors, less DATA sectors into cache
    * dos_mkdir tuned (was ~0.5 sec on 64K cluster partitions)

2001 Apr 29 - Build 2024
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Fixes  Bart:
	 * fixed the "TYPE > FOO.TXT" poor man's editor.
	 * use "fast console output" (int 29) when applicable.
	 * moved 5 FILES to DOS DS:00CC and fixed the SFT linked list.
	 * cleaned up findfirst/findnext for redirected drives.
	 Tom:
	 * more VDISK changes (changed slightly by Bart)
	 * check for presence of A:/B: (changed by Bart to use the BIOS equipment flag
	    from INT11 instead of INT13).
	 * added F5/F8 stepping through config.sys; default SHELL=COMMAND.COM /P/E:256
	   Use ESC to stop single stepping, F5 to skip remaining config.sys/autoexec.bat.
	 * new sys: uses INT25/26 instead of the low level INT13 related kernel code from
	    floppy.asm (see also comments in sys.c) + a few fixes (also boot.asm related)
	    from Bart.
	 * Hopefully fixed DateTime Changed + ATTRIB |= ARCHIVE bug.
	 * cleaned up dsk.c and saved more bytes.
	 Przemyslaw Czerpak:
	 * Default lastdrive should be 5 (E) not 6 (F).
	 * fixed not ignoring whitespace after '=' in config.sys
	 * noted INT21/AX=3800 bug for getting the country. Put in a workaround for now.

2001 Apr 21 - Build 2024
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Fixes  Tom:
         * fixed a missing close_dir in fatfs.c.
         * many reductions of stack space requirements.
         we hope this fixes some FAT corruption problems.
         Bart:
         * fixed "copy con" and INT21/AH=0B. The SFT_FEOF flag,
           strangely enough, if true indicates NOT end-of-file.
         * VDISK signature required in HMA (bug 701 dborca@usa.net).
         Alan Kamrowski
         * fixed intr: it wasn't putting the flags back correctly
           and swapped si and bp.
+ Update Bart:
         * Changed initialization data segment to its code segment.
           This frees up a few more kb.
         * This required some header reorganisation:
           init-mod.h is for the init modules, globals.h for all the
           others.
         * Eliminated the master environment, as it is normally
           managed by command.com, not by the kernel. This saves 512
           bytes and command.com now copies a default environment from
           0068:0000; this is in the DOS_PSP at 60:0.
         * Moved low memory code segment to 70:0.
+ Add    Tom:
         * Default interrupt 6 handler (invalid opcode).

2001 Apr 16 - Build 2024
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Fixes  * Use turboc.cfg to avoid long command lines; edit ALLCFLAGS
           in config.mak to enable DEBUG etc.
         * Fixed critical error handler.
         * Fixed loading .exe's in UMBs if not enough space available.
         * Some device drivers require \r\n at the end of their
           parameter line.


2001 Apr 16 - Build 2023
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Fixes  * Thanks to Martin Stromberg for pointing some bugs out:
         * more warnings fixed.
	 * accidentally opened too many file handles at boot time.
	 * device drivers should not be linked into the device chain
	   if they do not take up memory.
+ Add	 * added printf "%S" and "%Fs" to print far strings.
         * enabled and cleaned up INT21/AH=6C (extended open/create).

2001 Apr 15 - Build 2023
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Fixes  Tom:
         * apisupt.asm not necessary anymore.
         * fix warnings.
         * Don't allow directories to be created in DOS_CREAT.
         * LoadDevice: drivers should not hang the computer if they fail.
         Bart:
         * fixed SYS.
         * made most calls near again, with a jump/stack trick to
           switch between INIT_TEXT and HMA_TEXT.
         * INIT_TEXT now calls INT21 itself for some things (setting
           PSP, opening/reading/closing devices and (fd)config.sys).
         * fixed some carry handling in inthndlr.c and
         * drives are checked before trying to access them.
         * fixed console driver "busy state" confusion: the built-in
           driver had it wrong, nansi.sys had it right:
           "If no characters in buffer, return BUSY".
         * space savings (RTL related and various other places)
         * redirector fixes for find_next.
         * CREAT on a device file failed (FD said it already existed).
           But for some reason it should not fail in DOS.
         * get ATTRIB/other things on a device file should return
           FILENOTFOUND, not PATHNOTFOUND.
           The sft_status field is not used for redirected drives.
         * DosSelectDrv checks the media before setting the default
           drive.
         * Fixed INT21/AH=3,4,5 (character R/W AUX/PRN).
         Hans Lermen:
         * critical error handler destroyed AH (entry.asm).
         Martin Stromberg
         * find_first for volume labels fix.
         * check drive at more places and avoid drive "@:" for drive "':".
         * config.m: comment out NASM= by default.
         * printf fix with DEBUG on.
+ Add    Tom: Introduce init_data segment.
              New temp file creation implementation.
         Bart: added INT21/AH=53. XMSDSK works fine now.
               dynamic allocation of Drive Parameter Blocks (they are
               all FAR now).
+ Update Bart: moved DOS_PSP to segment 0x60 as segment 0x50 is already used by
	       GWBASIC/BASICA

2001 Apr  2 - Build 2023
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Fixes  Bart: Volkov Commander revealed a few bugs:
	  -int 21/ah=55 forgot to set current psp to child psp.
  	  -memory allocation: mem_access_mode was a signed byte, and hence 0x80 was
  	   translated to 0xff80 and not 0x0080 when converting to a COUNT. Hence
  	   changed it to become a UBYTE.
  	  -An error in memmgr.c: search again in low mem for modes 0x80,81,82, not
  	   0x40,0x41,0x42
	 * execrh.asm & int2f.asm: made code executable on a 8088 (no push
	   constant)
	 * entry.asm: made sure dos_crit_sect is executed when required to.
	 * Another redirector fix. int 2f/1122 needed DS=current psp. This caused a
           bug for me: after compiling FreeCOM on a redirected drive "dir" did not
  	   work any more.
	 * The nansi.sys problem: as it was, the initialisation phase of nansi
  	   called int/ah=30, which checked control-break, which checks the console
  	   driver, which at that point is the still not initialized nansi. This
  	   messed up the request header passed to it. A solution I found is to link
  	   a device into the device chain _after_ initialisation, not before.
	 * Redirector fix: network.c uses fmemcpy instead of fsncopy.
	 * Fixed INT 21/AH=6 (direct console input).
         Tom:
         * DE_NFILES instead of DE_FILENOTFOUND to allow Volkov Commander to browse empty
           drives.
         * Fixed bug wrt zero terminated device names (should be spaces terminated).

2001 Mar 30 - Build 2023
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Fixes  Tom: Kernel alloc initialises to 0. This avoids some weird errors.
              Implemented default divide by 0 handler (INT 0)
              FILES= fixes from config.sys. fatfs.c ignored it and always
              used the default of 16.
              Misc debug code removal.
              int 21/ax=3306 report running HIGH fix.
              int 21/ah=69 : save CX
              InitializeAllBPBs() or MakeNortonDiskEditorHappy()
              More extended information if MCB chain corruption occurs.
         Bart: getdpb fixes (int 21/ah=32).
               fix carry handling in int 21/ah=5e.

2001 Mar 28 - Build 2023
--------
+ Fixes  Bug fix release 2023b: dsk.c (reported by Nagy Daniel), inthndlr and
	 int25/26 fixes by Tom Ehlert.

2001 Mar 27 - Build 2023
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Fixes  Bug fix release 2023a: fixed stack segment bug in entry.asm.

2001 Mar 25 - Build 2023
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Fixes  sys.com compilation: it is a proper .com and works again.
	 Suggestions from Martin Stromberg: warning removal and some
	 debugging related changes.
	 Suggestion from Aitor Santamaria Merino: implemented NUMLOCK=ON/OFF
         in config.sys. Also implemented strcasecmp.
	 Updated intfns.txt; reported version is now 5.0.


2001 Mar 24 - Build 2022
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Fixes  Tom and Bart: cli/sti handling and other fixes in entry.asm,
         procsupt.asm and apisupt.asm.
         Bart: warning removal + other compile time fixes.
         Tom: * more partition detection fixes in dsk.c.
              * dos_gettime() fix.

2001 Mar 21 - Build 2022
-------- Bart Oldeman (bart@dosemu.org)
+ Clean  A lot of space savings by Tom Ehlert, merely because Turbo C 2.01 does not
         do it. And several more complicated situations as well, like coding some
	 string functions in assembly (asmsupt.asm).
+ Add    Tom Ehlert: support for DOS=HIGH. Now most of the kernel can be loaded into
         the HMA. This required a lot of segmentation changes. Let's hope the best
	 of it. Support for device drivers with multiple devices.
+ Fixes  From Tom Ehlert:
         task.c bug fix (image_size is in bytes)
	 dosfns.c change dir to E:\FREEDOS\*.PRJ fix
	 fcbfns.c fixes.
	 break.c Ctrl-C Ctrl-C -> crash temporary fix.
+ Fixes  From Bart:
	 Let UMBs work again after HMA changes.
	 Be able to compile sys.com again. Is now really a .exe file but still masks
	 as .com in the hope that we can make it a real .com again.
	 DeviceHigh loads low if there are not enough UMB's available.
	 Fixed another redirector problem.
+ Update Optimized asmsupt.asm a bit with help of the glibc 2.2 source.	
+ Fixes  Tom Ehlert and Brian Reifsnyder: fix partition detection in dsk.c +
         other bug fixes (also: floppy.asm).
+ Update Tom Ehlert optimized blockio.c.
+ Fixes  a few small ones from Tom I forgot.

         Configuration for libm.mak is in config.mak (Martin Stromberg)
         NLS fix to include pointer to CharMapSrvc. Note: these are
          changes to automatically generated .asm files, but the
          generator (GRAB_UNF.EXE) is missing. (thanks Tom Ehlert)
         DosSelectDrv fix (Martin Stromberg)
         config.c always converts to upper case and handles dos=umb correctly

         2000/08/12 22:49:00  Ron Cemer (roncemer@gte.net)
         Fixed writeblock() to only use getbuf() if writing a
         complete sector; otherwise use getbloc() and do a
         read-modify-write to prevent writing garbage back
         over pre-existing data in the file.
         This was a major BUG.

         command using Dosemu Lredir. Fixed Dosfns return for ReadCount,
         WriteCount and  DosGetFattr. Fixed the return in int2f.asm for
         Read/Write Remote. By adding xor ax,ax.

2000 May 26 - Build 2020
-------- James Tabor (jimtabor@infohwy.com)
+ Fixed  IsDevice is used in FcbFns.c and DosFns.c. I removed IsDevice
         from DosNames.c an placed it in DosFns.c. FcbFns had dup code
         and it was removed. This fixed all the functions using IsDevice.

         Truename works now. I consider it dangerous and brain damaged.
         Note:
          truename X:\DIR\con -> X:/CON, note the '/'.
          truename foo*.* -> X:\DIR\FOO?????.???
          truename *.*\*.*\*.* -> ????????.???\????????.???\????????.???
          truename *.*\*.**\*.* -> endless Loop
             I will fix this later ;^)

         Found InitPSP running 3 time. On the 2'nd run the standard handles
         were closed with out DosClose. Now Device Drivers can Print out
         there startup info.

+ Fixed	 Lastdrive handling
+ Fixed	 Not enough drives for number present devices
+ Added    Working (though not perfect network redirector)
           Note: Error codes internal to freedos are negative
                 Error codes external to freedos are postive.
                 The network redirector is external to freedos...
           Note: Running the nonredirected functions on a redirected
                 drive is dangerous.   My patch is very careful
                 not to.  Except in truename.  Where (a) it is safe
                 and (b) I think it is required, and (c) it is needed
                 by dosemu.

-------- Steffen Kaiser (Steffen.Kaiser@fh-rhein-sieg.de)
+ Fixed Config.c COUNTRY= statement
+ Fixed *.c to call upFMem() when upcasing filenames
- Removed everything to load NLS into memory
= Redesigned hardcoded NLS information

--> The kernel will now return the proper information for the
    hardcoded NLS (U.S.A. / CP437), it would return the correct
    information for other NLS, too, if there would be a NLSFUNC
    available, which is not at this time.

NOTE: The way the external NLSFUNC is called does not look well,
therefore expect a change soon.

2000 Mar 15 - Build 2019
-------- James Tabor (jimtabor@infohwy.com)
* Dennis Newbold and Massimo De Munari email kernel bug reports
  with changes to Globals.h and Inthndlr.c. Fix to leap year and
  Delete file return code.
* Michal Meller found a bug in media_check. It return the wrong
  value of sector count. Change in FATFS.C.
* Fixed Func 0x32 based on information from Marty <k3pbu@arrl.net>.
  Func 0x32 Get Drive Parameter BLK did not work.


2000 Mar 09 - Build 2018
-------- James Tabor (jimtabor@infohwy.com)
Added   CDS and made FD CDS based. Changes encompass all of the
	code for FD.
Fixed   Task.c, rewritten code from FINODE to SFT function calls.
	Unable to execute from CD. Main.c and Config.c has small
	changes.
Fixed   Device drivers are unable to write to con. Rewritten code to
	relocate DOS_PSP pointer to 050:0000. Removed references to
	DOS_PSP in DosFns.c.
Added   Network and Redirection function calls in Inthndlr.c and
	network.c.

I have a note in FatFs.c line 313, describing functions not yet
supported for networking. I don't understand Pats thoughts on SFT to
FINODE. IMHO it would have been easier to stay with SFT all through
the code.

I tested MS-Dos 6.22 Command and found it unable to do Find First or
Next. This too could explain why MSCDEX does the same thing. I only
test this with the current FDCommand at the time, so this could have
changed.


1999 Sep 24 - Build 2017
-------- John Price (linux-guru@gcfl.net)
* Per Jens Horstmeier's email, changed boot sector code to make
  Siemens CDROM's bootable.  The changes should be OK for all other
  machines too (in theory).


1999 Sep 22 - Build 2016
-------- John Price (linux-guru@gcfl.net)
* Turned off debug output from the kernel.  It does not seem to be
  necessary at this time.
* Changed boot sector to do single-sector reads instead of
  multi-sector reads.  Appearantly this was part of the reason the
  kernel would not boot from a 720K, or other format floppies.  Thanx
  to Charles Dye for the info.

1999 Sep 16 - Build 2016
-------- James Tabor (jimtabor@infohwy.com)
* Added Networking and Server Call
* Added Dos Idle call
* fixed Console.asm ConInStat


1999 Sep 13 - Build 2014
-------- John Price (linux-guru@gcfl.net)
* Deleted some files from the drivers directory that were not being
  used.
* Changed the LIB.MAK file so it would work for TC2 or TC3 or higher.
* Changed SYS.COM so that it creates a sys.log file with more debug
  information to help debug problems with making boot disks.

1999 Sep 13 - Build 2014
-------- James Tabor (jimtabor@infohwy.com)
* Submitted changes to CONSOLE.ASM & INTHNDLR.ASM to fix the INT21
  func 0B bug.

1999 Sep 13 - Build 2014
-------- Helmut Fritsch (helmut.fritsch@gcd-hs.de)
* Submitted changes to CONSOLE.ASM to fix the INT21 func 0B bug.

1999 Sep 10 - Build 2014
-------- ror4 (f2xm1@crosswinds.net)
* At the suggestion of Mr John Price, modified the int 0x25 and int
  0x26 so that they no longer update the disk buffers (int 0x26 only
  invalidates the buffers for the specified drive). This is to avoid
  inconsistent disk buffers from appearing in the buffer chain due to
  interactions between int 0x25/0x26 and file read/write operations.


1999 Aug 24 - Build 2013
-------- John Price (linux-guru@gcfl.net)
* With ideas from ror4, I redid the build batch file so you can
  specify where what make to use.
* Also created CONFIG.M and CONFIG.B which should be copied to
  CONFIG.MAK and CONFIG.BAT, respecively, and edited to reflect the
  users configuration.  This keeps new versions from replacing the
  configuration files so the user does not have to keep reseting
  their configutation.

1999 Aug 15 - Build 2013
-------- ror4 (ror4@angelfire.com)
* Patched the source so that it can be compiled with Turbo C 2.01.
  (`asm' statements were rewritten into very ugly equivalents... they
  probably need more work. :( )
* Modified the `dmatch' structure in `hdr/dirmatch.h' so that the
  `dm_dirstart' field is in the right place, and also to make it
  compile under TC 2.01, which doesn't allow bit fields of any types
  other than signed or unsigned int.
* Fixed a few minor bugs in error code returning in `kernel/fatfs.c'.


1999 Jul 16 - Build 2012
-------- ror4 (ror4@iname.com)
* Finally ported all the assembly modules to `nasm'. *phew*
* Undid plonee's patches to `kernel/fatfs.c' (sorry). They were
  causing the resulting findfirst/findnext DTA structures to be
  incompatible with MSDOS's.
* Also rewrote all the pattern copying code in `dos_findfirst' in
  `kernel/fatdir.c' to prevent a bad buffer overflow problem.
* Modified the disk buffer handling code, so that logical sector
  numbers in disk buffers are now 0-based instead of 1-based.
* int 0x25 and int 0x26 now do multi-sector reads/writes.

1999 Jul 14 - Build 2012
-------- ror4 (ror4@iname.com)
* Ported the modules in the `drivers/' branch to `nasm'.


1999 May 04 - Build 2011
-------- ror4 (ror4@cryogen.com)
* Fixed the code for converting day numbers into Julian calendar
  dates: the first and last days of each month are now returned
  correctly.
* Undid a change to the code to get the day of the week.

1999 May 02 - Build 2011
-------- John Price (linux-guru@gcfl.net)
* blockio.c: changed getblock and getbuf so that they leave at least
  3 FAT type buffers valid.  This helps because the FAT is accessed
  very often compared to other sectors.
* fatfs.c: Fixed a bug in map_cluster so it will optimize FAT reads
  on disks that have more than one sector per cluster.  This
  sigificantly improved disk access of big files on hard drives.

1999 May 02 - Build 2011
-------- ror4 (ror4@cryogen.com)
* Corrected the `struct buffer' definition in `kernel/globals.h' so
  that it corresponds exactly to Ralf Brown's description of a DOS 3.x
  buffer.
* Also fixed the problem with FATs > 255 sectors, by making use of an
  originally unused field in the buffer structure.

1999 May 01 - Build 2011
-------- ror4 (ror4@cryogen.com)
* Fixed a problem which caused disk corruption on partitions with
  FATs larger than 127 sectors. (However, FATs larger than 255
  sectors may still experience problems -- this is due to a
  limitation of the DOS 3.x buffering scheme.)
* Fixed a bug in the handling of the `stacks=' command in
  `(fd)config.sys' which caused the system to behave strangely.

1999 Apr 22 - Build 2011
-------- Steffen Kaiser (Steffen.Kaiser@fh-rhein-sieg.de)
bugfix: memmgr.c: Invalid returned largest size in MemLargest()
fix: memmgr.c: DosMemLargest: change prototype to match its useage
bugfix: inthdlr.c: 0x49: ES is decremented
fix: inthdlr.c: 0x00: DosMemCheck() does nothing --> added panic()
fix: inthdlr.c: 0x4c: DosMemCheck() does nothing --> added panic()
fix: inthdlr.c: 0x00: changed to make it the same as DOS-4C-00
	Both actions differed e.g. in ErrorMode
chg: memmgr.c: the 'name' field of the MCB is never initialized by
	DOS-48, DOS-49 or DOS-4A. Leave this to the program loading function.
bugfix: memmgr.c: adjust_far() / add_far():
	Both function together (and the way they are used) don't make sense:
	adjust_far() normalizes a far pointer, add_far() generates a linear
	address. Usually both are used this way:
		far_poi = adjust_far(far_poi);
		while(...) {
			...
			far_poi = add_far(far_poi, uword);
			...
		}
	First one makes sure that 'far_poi' is normalized, then far_poi
	becomes a linear address, which makes it very difficult to use
	it, because the possibility to get a segment warp gets very high.
	-->
		Change: add_far() also returns a normalized real mode pointer
		as adjust_far() does.
	Probably in DOS-C supporting various architecures thee functions
	served other duties, but the current useage is highly dangerous.
bugfix: task.c: ChildEnv(): nEnvSize didn't counted the last '\0'
bugfix: task.c: ChildEnv(): Allocation: maximum absolute filename to
	short and forgot the word counter
bugfix: task.c: ChildEnv(): for very corrupt environments, the
	copy function failed.
bugfix: task.c: DosExeLoader(): If exe_size > allocated_size or
	DosMemLargest() failes, the environment is not deallocated
bugfix: task.c: DosExeLoader(): Calculating the exe_size to be
	allocated. At both places (+ header.exMinAlloc & ...MaxAlloc)
	sizeof(psp) is added to exe_size. Why? image_size already
	contains sizeof(psp).
chg: task.c: DosExeLoader()/DosComLoader(): MCB patching and command
	line copying is no outside of those functions
chg: asmsupt.asm: _fbcopy: re-use parts of _bcopy
add: asmsupt.asm: fmemset, fmemclr, fmemclra {Replace the explicit
	for() loops}

1999 Apr 22 - Build 2011
-------- ror4 (ror4@cryogen.com)
* Ported boot.asm to NASM.  The plan is to port all assembly to NASM
  over time.


1999 Apr 19 - Build 2010
-------- John Price (linux-guru@gcfl.net)
* Undid the change I made to getblock below because it DID NOT speed
anything up, and in fact slowed access down.


1999 Apr 18 - Build 2009
-------- John Price (linux-guru@gcfl.net)
* change getblock so that it flushes all buffers for a drive when it
  has to flush one of them to make room.  This should speed disk
  access slightly.
* Change the boot sector so there is a compile-time option to use
  multi-sector IO or single-sector IO.  The default is multi since
  ror4 seemed to have fixed the problem we had before.

1999 Apr 18 - Build 2009
-------- ror4 (ror4@cryogen.com)
* The boot sector can now load the kernel properly from a hard disk.
* Other minor changes.


1999 Apr 16 - Build 2008
-------- ror4 (ror4@cryogen.com)
* Modified the block device driver to prepare it for multi-sector I/O
  support.  Among other things, the driver can now handle transfer
  buffers which cross DMA boundaries.
* Some other minor changes.

1999 Apr 15 - Build 2008
-------- John Price (linux-guru@gcfl.net)
* Changed mainly the map_cluster function in fatfs.c so that instead
  of starting at the beginning of the FAT chain every time, it will
  be smart about it, and start at the last FAT location that it was
  before if it can.  This speeds up disk access considerably
  especially on slower machines.

1999 Apr 15 - Build 2008
-------- Steffen Kaiser (Steffen.Kaiser@fh-rhein-sieg.de)
bugfix: ^Break handler according cmt1.txt
bugfix: DosCreat(): Detection for Devices and extension:
	the semi-colon behind if(*froot) is definitely wrong, whether
	one wants CON.EXT to be interpreted as CON or not.
bugfix: DosOpen(): dito

* Re-implementation of ^Break handler -- 1999/03/27 ska
  + Warning: The handle_break() function assumes that the InDOS flag
  was incremented (except if ErrorMode is true). Never call
  handle_break() unless the InDOS flag has been incremented within
  this reentrant call of DOS.

  + ^Break is detected and handled at certain places within the
  kernel only:  a) within the CON: device when reading or writing a
  character, and b) when entering the INT-21 service (if extended
  break checking is enabled).  At these places the process flow can
  be modified to: either a) redo the interrupted function or b) abort
  the currently running process.

  + Both actions are performed by switching back to the user stack
  and enter INT-21 handler again. If to terminate the program, AX is
  modified into 4C00h.

  + By default, if the user has no ^Break handler installed, the
  program is terminated.

  + Heavy change: The original implementation installed an unique
  INT-23 handler that directly called the actions performed
  DOS-4C-XX.  In fact, this was identically with when the user had an
  own handler installed and returned the Carry flag set, except that
  it was somewhat quicker, because the kernel need not decode the
  4C00h command.  Now the Carry flag is set prior the call of INT-23,
  so the default action is to terminate the program.

  + Note: INT-23 is called with all registers as they are passed to
  the INT-21 entry. When they are modified, they are passed
  _modified_ to the API interpreter. This also allows the DOS1-style
  termination by to load register AH with 0 (zero).

  + RBIL says:
     "any DOS call may safely be made within the INT 23 handler,
     although the handler must check for a recursive invocation if it
     does call DOS"
  This can be interpreted so or so, the problem is that the user can
  call DOS again, what would overwrite the saved _usr_stack pointer
  with a different value and, therefore, cannot be used to check if
  INT-23 was returned by RETF or RETF2/IRET.

  Because a recursive invokation of INT-23 is to prevented by the
  user, the kernel could internally save SP to somewhere else.
  However:
  a) where?
  b) is it reliable that the user ever returns from INT-23 at all?

  The implemented method uses the same mechanism as fail-safe intr()
  function is implemented: A little piece of code is constructed
  within the stack, which contains the value of SP as an operand of
  an immediate MOV instruction.


1999 Apr 13 - Build 2007
-------- ror4 (ror4@cryogen.com)
* The boot sector now moves itself to the last 512 bytes of
  conventional memory instead of a lower memory location.
* The kernel startup code has also been modified so that it works
  with the new boot sector.

1999 Apr 12 - Build 2007
-------- ror4 (ror4@cryogen.com)
* The directory scanning functions (`findfirst'/`findnext') now also
  recognize more flavours of the volume label attribute byte (namely
  0x09, 0x28 and 0x29).
* Subdirectories are now no longer assumed to have the same size as
  the root directory.
* `device/device.lib' is now included as a dependency in the kernel
  makefile.
* Removed several unused assembler modules from the `device/' branch
  (see `device/device.mak').

1999 Apr 11 - Build 2007
-------- ror4 (ror4@cryogen.com)
* The kernel now reads times from the system clock (0x40:0x6c)
  instead of the RTC. The RTC is only used during startup to
  initialize the system clock. (As a side effect of this,
  `ReadATClock' has been moved from `_TEXT' to `INIT_TEXT'.)
* Checking for leap years is now improved -- year numbers which are
  divisible by 100 but not by 400 are not counted as leap years. (Not
  that it matters for year 2000, though.)
* The scaling factor used to convert the system time count to a
  second count has been changed from 18.2 to the more accurate (?)
  19663/1080.
* Day numbers used by `clock$' are now 0-based (as in MSDOS) instead
  of 1-based. Thus 1 Jan 1980 is now day number 0.

1999 Apr 10 - Build 2007
-------- ror4 (ror4@cryogen.com)
* Added code to prevent the kernel from returning path names
  containing double backslashes.

1999 Apr 9 - Build 2007
-------- ror4 (ror4@usa.net)
* File handles are now cloned properly when a child process is spawned.
* The `DosClose' function now also frees SFT entries corresponding to
  devices, not only those entries corresponding to files.
* Removed a (minor) memory corruption bug in the code for int 0x21,
  ah = 0x09.

1999 Apr 6 - Build 2007
-------- ror4 (ror4@cryogen.com)
* Functions ax = 0x5700 and 0x5701 (get/set file date and time) now
  return the right values at the right times. (They used to return
  success when there's an error, and return error when there's a
  success.)
* Removed the `/k' switch to the linker in `sys/sys.mak'.


1999 Apr 4 - Build 2006
-------- John Price (linux-guru@gcfl.net)
* added "version=" directive so that you can change the version that
  the kernel reports.  Usage: version=<major>.<minor> (i.e.
  version=6.22)

1999 Apr 4 - Build 2006
-------- ror4 (ror4@usa.net)
* Fixed the file name parsing function (`ParseDosNames') so that it
  handles single-character path names correctly.
* Also modified the functions which call `ParseDosNames' to check its
  return value instead of assuming that it is always successful.
  (This is not currentl useful, but it will be when error checking is
  introduced into `ParseDosNames'. In other words, there'll be more
  changes to `ParseDosNames' in the near future...)

* After wondering for a long time why the kernel text segment was
  always getting corrupted when I ran DJGPP `bash' 1.14.7, I finally
  decided to examine the code occurring before the handler for int
  0x21, ah = 0x60, and I found out why... :)
* Fixed the problem of int 0x21, ax = 0x5d06 causing memory
  corruption.
* Corrected the types of `internal_data', `swap_always' and
  `swap_indos' in `kernel/globals.h'.

* Improved checking for invalid file names in `ParseDosName'
  (although I'm still not sure whether the check is water-tight or
  not).
* Changed the default path setting from `PATH=' to `PATH=.'.

* Output from character I/O functions now goes to standard output as
  it should, instead of the console. Also, there's now a clear
  distinction between console input/output and standard input/output.
* Tabs are now expanded during writes to the console device.
* Removed a hard-wired limit on the number of entries in a JFT.
  (Although I'm not sure whether this is really correct...)
* Many other changes to the file descriptor handling code.

1999 Mar 29 - Build 2006
-------- John Price (linux-guru@gcfl.net)
* Changed boot loader so it prints some feedback info while booting.
  Removed code to handle FAT12 and FAT16, and code to calculate the
  start of the fat, rootdir, and data.  Moved these functions into
  the sys command.  Now there are two versions of the boot loader
  created, one to handle FAT16, and one for FAT12.  These are
  hard-coded into the sys command, so the need for the boot.bin file
  is obsolete.
* created a new program (bin2c) to convert the boot loader binary
  file into a header file that can be included in the sys program as
  an array of bytes.

1999 Mar 29 - Build 2006
-------- ror4 (ror4@usa.net)
* Changed the class of `_BSSEND' from "STACK" to "BSS" in the
  `drivers/' branch (which I forgot about in my last patch).
* Removed all traces of the `CONST' segment, since it was causing
  `IGROUP' to be assimilated into `DGROUP', which shouldn't happen.
* Added a `(void)' cast to the `setvec' macro in `kernel/globals.h'
  (`setvec' no longer returns the original ISR vector).
* Changed an incorrect error message in `sys/sys.c'.
* Removed `drivers/setvec.asm', since it's no longer needed.
* Also removed `kernel/krnstart'.
* The name field in a process's MCB is now filled in the same manner
  as in MSDOS -- instead of being padded to the right with spaces, it
  is now terminated with '\0'. Also, if the original file name
  doesn't have an extension, the code will stop copying the file name
  at '\0' instead of continuing to look for a '.'.
* Fixed the problem of the `switchar' syscall (int 0x21, ax = 0x3700) not
  returning the correct value.


1999 Mar 28 - Build 2005
-------- ror4 (ror4@usa.net)
* Removed the need for `ipl.sys'. (!) The kernel makefile now
  statically relocates `kernel.exe' to 0x60:0 and outputs the
  resulting binary to `kernel.sys', and the boot sector has also been
  modified to load `kernel.sys' at 0x60:0 instead of `ipl.sys' at
  0x2000:0. (I chose 0x60:0 because it's the first 512-byte boundary
  occurring after the BIOS data area, 0x40:0.) Finally, `sys.com' has
  also been updated.

* Also changed the boot sector code in some other ways. In
  particular, because `kernel.sys' is rather large, I had to add some
  code to move the boot sector away from 0:0x7c00 to somewhere
  higher. (For 640K systems the boot sector will be shifted to
  0x6000:0x7c00. However, there may be problems on systems with very
  little conventional memory -- I'll probably look into this later.)

* Made some minor changes to the assembler source files so that they
  can compile on `masm'. (JP: The code still compiles fine with tasm
  too).

* Also changed several incorrect label references in the assembler
  sources. (JP: These changes fixed the "Fixup" errors we been
  talking about in the list)

* Eliminated redundant re-makes of files in the various makefiles.
  For one thing, `*.cfg' files are no longer generated from the
  makefiles, but are independent from them. (I didn't like the idea
  of having to compile an entire branch each time I edit a
  makefile...) Also, intermediate files are now retained instead of
  deleted.

* Also made some changes to `build.bat' (you'll know them when you
  see them).

* Added a file `lib/libm.mak'

* Added a file `kernel/krnstart

* The code required to initialize the kernel (or rather most of it)
  is no longer retained in memory after the initialization process is
  done. I accomplished this by moving most of the initialization code
  from `_TEXT' to a new segment named `INIT_TEXT'. Of course, I also
  had to introduce lots of other changes in order for everything to
  compile and run properly:
  - Added code to `kernel/src/kernel/kernel.asm' to move the contents
    of `INIT_TEXT' to the top of conventional memory and continue
    from there.  Control is only transferred back to `_TEXT' when the
    kernel calls `p_0'.
  - Many functions are called from both `_TEXT' and `INIT_TEXT'. To
    fix this, I created far wrappers for these functions which can
    then be called from `INIT_TEXT'. (E.g. for `execrh' there's a
    corresponding far function named `init_call_execrh' which simply
    calls `execrh' with its own parameters.) One exception to this is
    `printf' -- instead of creating a far wrapper for a near
    `printf', I created a near wrapper for a far `printf' (now called
    `init_call_printf'), because it was easier that way. :)
  - Most functions which are required only during initialization time
    were shifted into `INIT_TEXT'. (There are still some functions
    which should rightfully go into `INIT_TEXT', but are retained in
    `_TEXT' as far functions, because I found it too difficult to
    move them out. :( ) Because Turbo C only allows at most one code
    segment to be defined for each module, I had to shift some
    functions around within the source tree -- the file
    `kernel/src/kernel/proto.h' says it all.
  - A cosmetic change mentioned here for completeness: all functions
    defined in `INIT_TEXT' are now marked with the word `INIT' (in
    fact a null macro) so that the reader can easily distinguish them
    from functions defined in `_TEXT'.

* Replaced `exit' calls with `for (;;);'.

* Changed `strcpy' into a macro which calls `scopy'.

* Also redefined `setvec' to be a macro (I didn't want to waste time
  writing a far wrapper for it).

* Removed the `break_key' function in `kernel/src/kernel/kernel.asm'.

* `low_int25_handler' and `low_int26_handler' are now of type
  `void interrupt far()' instead of `void near()'. (I hope I updated
  `entry.asm' correctly -- I never tested `int 0x25' and `int 0x26'...)

* Changed the class of `_BSSEND' from "STACK" to "BSS" -- "STACK" is
  now used for a separate stack segment (`_STACK').

* Assembler modules now include `segs.inc' instead of having their
  own long list of segment definitions. (Some day I'll update the
  makefile dependencies to reflect this.)

* Also made a few minor changes to the assembler modules so that
  `masm' won't complain.

* Changed the `-X' switch in `kernel.cfg' to `-X-', so that I don't
  have to worry about C module dependencies.

* Removed the definition of `CFLAGS' from the makefile -- everything
  is now in `kernel.cfg'.

* Created a file `kernel/src/kernel/init-mod.h' which is included by
  modules whose code is supposed to go into `INIT_TEXT' instead of
  `TEXT'.

* This diff solves the problem of the MCB of a process not having a
  correct value in its name field (bug report #6).
  (The definition of the `toupper' macro is because I shifted the
  `toupper' function into `INIT_TEXT' a while ago, and therefore
  can't be called from `_TEXT' now...)


-------- John Price (linux-guru@gcfl.net)
* Made changes so you can create a directory with the same name as a
  volume label, but you still can't rename or delete it!

* Fix findfirst and findnext functions so that act as they should.
  (i.e. If the attrib has only the volume label set, then it returns
  the volume label entry in the root directory, else it returns the
  files/directories that are specified with the attrib, ignoring the
  read-only and archive bits (these are always returned).

* reorginize the source tree.  Removed IPL directory, and command.
  Moved all the file system C files into the kernel directory.
  Modifed build.bat, clean.bat, and all the make files to reflect the
  new tree.

* changed so that kernel will look for a "fdconfig.sys" file, and use
  it INSTEAD of config.sys.  If it does not find it, it will look
  for, and read config.sys, if it exists.

* Fixed so that if you call an INT 21 function with AH containing a
  unsupported function, the carry flag is set.
