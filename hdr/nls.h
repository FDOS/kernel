/*
 *	Description of the organization of NLS information -- 2000/02/13 ska
 *
 *	Glossar:
 *	NLS package -- NLS information incl. any code required to access or
 *		correctly interprete this particular information
 *
 *	Abbreviation:
 *	(NLS) pkg -- NLS package
 *
 *	The code included into the kernel does "only" support NLS packages
 *	structurally compatible with the one of the U.S.A. / CP437.
 *	I guess that most NLS packages has been tweaked to be compatible,
 *	so that this is not a real limitation, but for all other packages
 *	the external NLSFUNC can supply every piece of code necessary.
 *	To allow this the interface between the kernel and NLSFUNC has been
 *	extended; at the same time the interface has been reduced, because some
 *	of the API functions do not seem to offer any functionality required
 *	for now. This, however, may be a misinterpretation because of
 *	lack of understanding.
 *
 *	The supported structure consists of the following assumptions:
 *	1) The pkg must contain the tables 2 (Upcase character), 4
 *		(Upcase filename character) and 5 (filename termination
 *		characters); because they are used internally.
 *	2) The tables 2 and 4 must contain exactly 128 (0x80) characters.
 *		The character at index 0 corresponses to character 128 (0x80).
 *		The characters in the range of 0..0x7f are constructed out of
 *		the 7-bit US-ASCII (+ control characters) character set and are
 *		upcased not through the table, but by the expression:
 *			(ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z')? ch - 'a' + 'A': ch
 *			with: 'a' == 97; 'z' == 122; 'A' == 65
 *	3) The data to be returned by DOS-65 is enlisted in the
 *		nlsPointer[] array of the nlsPackage structure, including
 *		the DOS-65-01 data, which always must be last entry of the
 *		array.
 *	4) DOS-38 returns the 34 bytes beginning with the byte at offset
 *		4 behind the size field of DOS-65-01.
 *
 *	It seems that pure DOS can internally maintain two NLS pkgs:
 *	NLS#1: The hardcoded pkg of U.S.A. on CP437, and
 *	NLS#2: the pkg loaded via COUNTRY= from within CONFIG.SYS.
 *	I do interprete this behaviour as follows:
 *	CONFIG.SYS is read in more passes; before COUTRY= can be evaluated,
 *	many actions must be performed, e.g. to load kernel at all, open
 *	CONFIG.SYS and begin reading. The kernel requires at least two
 *	NLS information _before_ COUNTRY= has been evaluated - both upcase
 *	tables. To not implement the same function multiple times, e.g.
 *	to upcase with and without table, the kernel uses the default
 *	NLS pkg until a more appropriate one can be loaded and hopes that
 *	the BIOS (and the user) can live with its outcome.
 *	Though, theoretically, the hardcoded NLS pkg could be purged
 *	or overwritten once the COUNTRY= statement has been evaluated.
 *	It would be possible that this NLS pkg internally performs different
 *	purposes, for now this behaviour will be kept.
 *
 *	The current implementation extends the above "two maintained
 *	NLS pkgs" into that the kernel chains all NLS pkgs loaded in
 *	memory into one single linked list. When the user does neither
 *	wants to load other NLS pkgs without executing NLSFUNC and the
 *	loaded NLS pkgs do not contain code themselves, no other code is
 *	required, but some memory to store the NLS pkgs into.
 *
 *	Furthermore, because the kernel needs to include the code for the
 *	hardcoded NLS pkg anyway, every NLS pkg can use it; so only
 *	NLS pkgs that structurally differ from U.S.A./CP437 actually need
 *	to add any code and residently install the MUX handler for NLSFUNC.
 *	This technique reduces the overhead calling the MUX handler, when
 *	it is not needed.
 *	However, NLSFUNC is always required if the user wants to return
 *	information about NLS pkgs _not_ loaded into memory.
 *
 *=== Attention: Because the nlsInfoBlock structure differs from the
 *===	the "traditional" (aka MS) implementation, the MUX-14 interface
 *===	is _not_ MS-compatible, although all the registers etc.
 *===	do conform. -- 2000/02/26 ska
 *
 *	Previous failed attempts to implement NLS handling and a full-
 *	featured MUX-14 supporting any-structured NLS pkgs suggest
 *	to keep the implement as simple as possible and keep the
 *	optimization direction off balance and to tend toward either
 *	an optimization for speed or size.
 *
 *	The most problem is that the MUX interrupt chain is considered
 *	highly overcrowded, so if the kernels invokes it itself, the
 *	performance might decrease dramatically; on the other side, the
 *	more complex the interface between kernel and a _probably_ installed
 *	external NLSFUNC becomes the more difficult all the stuff is becoming
 *	and, most importantly, the size grows unnecessarily, because many
 *	people don't use NLSFUNC at all.
 *
 *	The kernel uses the NLS pkg itself for two operations:
 *	1) DOS-65-2x and DOS-65-Ax: Upcase character, string, memory area, &
 *	2) whenever a filename is passed into the kernel, its components
 *		must be identified, invalid characters must be detected
 *		and, finally, all letters must be uppercased.
 *	I do not consider operation 1) an action critical for performance,
 *	because traditional DOS programming praxis says: Do it Yourself; so
 *	one can consider oneself lucky that a program aquires the upcase
 *	table once in its life time (I mean: lucky the program calls NLS at all).
 *	Operation 2), in opposite, might dramatically reduce performance, if
 *	it lacks proper implementations.
 *
 *	Straight forward implementation:
 *	The basic implementation of the NLS channels all requests of DOS-65,
 *	DOS-66, and DOS-38 through MUX-14. Hereby, any external program, such
 *	as NLSFUNC, may (or may not) install a piece of code to filter
 *	one, few, or all requests in order to perform them itself, by default
 *	all requests will end within the root of the MUX interrupt, which is
 *	located within the kernel itself. An access path could look like this:
 *	1. Call to DOS-65-XX, DOS-66-XX, or DOS-38.
 *	2. The kernel is enterred through the usual INT-21 API handler.
 *	3. The request is decoded and one of the NLS.C function is called.
 *	4. This function packs a new request and calls MUX-14.
 *	5. Every TSR/driver hooking INT-2F will check, if the request is
 *		directed for itself;
 *	5.1. If not, the request is passed on to the next item of the MUX
 *		interrupt chain;
 *	5.2. If so, the TSR, e.g. NLSFUNC, tests if the request is to be
 *		performed internally;
 *	5.2.1. If so, the request is performed and the MUX-14 call is
 *		terminated (goto step 8.)
 *	5.2.2. If not, the request is passed on (see step 5.1.)
 *	6. If all TSRs had their chance to filter requests, but none decided
 *		to perform the request itself, the kernel is (re-)enterred
 *		through its INT-2F (MUX) API handler.
 *	7. Here the request is decoded again and performed with the kernel-
 *		internal code; then the MUX-14 call is terminated.
 *	8. When the MUX-14 call returns, it has setup all return parameters
 *		already, so the INT-21 call is terminated as well.
 *
 *	Note: The traditional MUX-14 is NOT supported to offer functionality
 *	to the kernel at the first place, but to let the kernel access and
 *	return any values they must be loaded into memory, but the user may
 *	request information through the DOS-65 interface of NLS pkgs _not_
 *	already loaded. Theoretically, NLSFUNC needs not allocate any internal
 *	buffer to load the data into, because the user already supplied one;
 *	also if the kernel would instruct NLSFUNC to load the requested
 *	NLS pkg, more memory than necessary would be allocated. However, all
 *	except subfunction 1 return a _pointer_ to the data rather than the
 *	data itself; that means that NLSFUNC must cache the requested data
 *	somewhere, but how long?
 *
 *	Performance tweaks:
 *	When the system -- This word applies to the combination of kernel and
 *	any loaded MUX-14 extension ï¿½ la NLSFUNC here. -- uppercases
 *	_filenames_, it must perform a DOS-65-A2 internally. In the basic
 *	implementation this request would be channeled through MUX-14, even
 *	if there is no external NLSFUNC at all. Also, when a NLS pkg had
 *	been loaded by the kernel itself, it complies to above mentioned
 *	rules and it is very unlikely that it is necessary to probe if
 *	a MUX-14 TSR might want to perform the request itself. Therefore
 *	each NLS pkg contains some flags that allow the kernel to bypass
 *	the MUX-14 request and invoke the proper function directly. Both
 *	default NLS pkgs will have those flags enabled, because they are
 *	already loaded into memory and must comply to the rules.
 *
 *	Note: Those flags do not alter the way the request is actually
 *	performed, but the MUX-14 call is omitted only (steps 4. through 6.).
 *
 *	======= Description of the API
 *
 *	There are three APIs to be supported by NLS:
 *	1) DOS API: DOS-38, DOS-65, DOS-66;
 *	2) MUX-14, and
 *	3) internal: upcasing filenames.
 *
 *	1) and 2) address the used NLS pkg by the country code / codepage pair.
 *	3) uses the currently active NLS pkg only; furthermore, these functions
 *	more or less match DOS-64-A*. Therefore, the NLS system merges the
 *	interfaces 1) and 3) and offers function suitable for both ones.
 *
 *	Both 1) and 3) must channel the request through the MUX chain, if
 *	appropriate, whereas 2) is the back-end and does natively process the
 *	request totally on its own.
 *
 *	The API of 1) and 3) consists of:
 *		+ DosUpChar(), DosUpString(), and DosUpMem(): to upcase an object
 *	(DOS-65-2[0-2]);
 *		+ DosYesNo(): to check a character, if it is the yes or no prompt
 *	(DOS-65-23);
 *		+ DosUpFChar(), DosUpFString(), and DosUpFMem(): to upcase an object
 *	for filenames (DOS-65-A[0-2]);
 *		+ DosGetData(): to retreive certain information (DOS-38, all the
 *	other DOS-65-** subfunctions);
 *		+ DosSetCountry(): to change the currently active country code
 *	(DOS-38);
 *		+ DosSetCodepage(): to change the currently active codepage (DOS-66).
 *
 *	The API of 2) consists of:
 *		+ syscall_MUX14().
 *	This function is invoked for all MUX-14 requests and recieves the
 *	registers of the particular INT-2F call, it will then decode the
 *	registers and pass the request forth to a NLS-internal interface
 *	consisting of the following "static" functions:
 *		+ nlsUpMem(): called for DosUp*(),
 *		+ nlsUpFMem(): called for DosUpF*(),
 *		+ nlsYesNo(): called for DosYesNo(),
 *		+ nlsGetData(): called for DosGetData(),&
 *		+ nlsSetPackage(): called for DosSetCountry() and DosSetCodepage().
 *	In opposite of the APIs 1) through 3) the NLS-internal functions address
 *	the NLS pkg to operate upon by a (struct nlsInfoBlock *) pointer.
 *
 *	This designs supports to easily implement to bypass the MUX chain to
 *	speed up especially the internal API to upcase filenames, because
 *	the Dos*() functions can decide do not pass the request through MUX,
 *	but directly call the nls*() function instead. This way it is ensured
 *	that the performed actions are the same in both cases and, with repect
 *	to the functions that operate with the currently active NLS pkg, the
 *	performance is rather high, because one can use the globally available
 *	pointer to the current NLS pkg and need not search for a country code/
 *	codepage pair.
 *
 *	======== Compile-time options
 *
 *	Win9x supports to change the individual portions of a NLS pkg
 *	through DOS-65-00; also there are no references what happens when
 *	a program changes the areas addressed by returned pointers. The
 *	current implementation does _not_ support changes of the NLS pkg
 *	except by invoking DOS-38 (Set Country Code) or DOS-66 (Set Codepage).
 *	Future implementations might offer this ability; to reduce the
 *	overhead introduced by this feature, the macro NLS_MODIFYABLE_DATA
 *	enables the appropriate code.
 *	NLS_MODIFYABLE_DATA is *disabled* by default.
 *
 *	The tables 2 and 4 (upcase tables) are accessed relatively often,
 *	but theoretically these tables could be located at any position
 *	of the pointer array. If the macro NLS_REORDER_POINTERS is enabled,
 *	both NLSFUNC and the internal loader will reorder the pointers
 *	array so that mandatory tables are located at predictable indexes.
 *	This removes that the kernel must search for the table when
 *	one of the DOS-65-[2A]x functions is called or a filename has been
 *	passed in (which must be uppercased to be suitable for internal
 *	purpose). However, when some program try to tweak the internal
 *	tables this assumption could be wrong.
 *	This setting has any effect only, if the kernel tries to access
 *	information itself; it is ignored when the user calls DOS-65-0x
 *	to return such pointer.
 *	NLS_REORDER_POINTERS is *enabled* by default.
 *      UPDATE: With NLS_REORDER_POINTERS, now table 7 (DBCS) is also
 *      expected to be located at a predictable index. -- eca

	===
	S4: function data
	In opposite of the structures and arrays, the function data
	is just a structure-less stream of bytes, which is used as it is.
	Currently no validation check is performed over this data.
	That means, for instance, that a definition of function 2 (upcase
	table) has length 130 and the data consists of a word value with
	the length (128) and 128 bytes individual information.
	That way the DBCS is implemented exactly the same way as all the
	other tables; the only exception is pseudo-table 0x23.
	===
	"relative position" means this DWord specifies the amount of bytes
	between end of the current structure and the data the pointer is
	referring to. This shall enable future implementations to embed
	COUNTRY.SYS into other files.
